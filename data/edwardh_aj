a
husky,
whispering
and
somewhat
broken
voice;
all
these
were
points
against
him,
but
not
all
of
these
together
could
explain
the
hitherto
unknown
disgust,
loathing
and
fear
with
which
Mr.
Utterson
regarded
him.
“There
must
be
something
else,”
said
the
perplexed
gentleman.
“There
is
something
more,
if
I
could
find
a
name
for
it.
God
bless
me,
the
man
seems
hardly
human!
Something
troglodytic,
shall
we
say?
or
can
it
be
the
old
story
of
Dr.
Fell?
or
is
it
the
mere
radiance
of
a
foul
soul
that
thus
transpires
through,
and
transfigures,
its
clay
continent?
The
last,
I
think;
for,
O
my
poor
old
Harry
Jekyll,
if
ever
I
read
Satan’s
signature
upon
a
face,
it
is
on
that
of
your
new
friend.”
Round
the
corner
from
the
by-street,
there
was
a
square
of
ancient,
handsome
houses,
now
for
the
most
part
decayed
from
their
high
estate
and
let
in
flats
and
chambers
to
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men;
map-engravers,
architects,
shady
lawyers
and
the
agents
of
obscure
enterprises.
One
house,
however,
second
from
the
corner,
was
still
occupied
entire;
and
at
the
door
of
this,
which
wore
a
great
air
of
wealth
and
comfort,
though
it
was
now
plunged
in
darkness
except
for
the
fanlight,
Mr.
Utterson
stopped
and
knocked.
A
well-dressed,
elderly
servant
opened
the
door.
“Is
Dr.
Jekyll
at
home,
Poole?”
asked
the
lawyer.
“I
will
see,
Mr.
Utterson,”
said
Poole,
admitting
the
visitor,
as
he
spoke,
into
a
large,
low-roofed,
comfortable
hall
paved
with
flags,
warmed
(after
the
fashion
of
a
country
house)
by
a
bright,
open
fire,
and
furnished
with
costly
cabinets
of
oak.
“Will
you
wait
here
by
the
fire,
sir?
or
shall
I
give
you
a
light
in
the
dining-room?”
“Here,
thank
you,”
said
the
lawyer,
and
he
drew
near
and
leaned
on
the
tall
fender.
This
hall,
in
which
he
was
now
left
alone,
was
a
pet
fancy
of
his
friend
the
doctor’s;
and
Utterson
himself
was
wont
to
speak
of
it
as
the
pleasantest
room
in
London.
But
tonight
there
was
a
shudder
in
his
blood;
the
face
of
Hyde
sat
heavy
on
his
memory;
he
felt
(what
was
rare
with
him)
a
nausea
and
distaste
of
life;
and
in
the
gloom
of
his
spirits,
he
seemed
to
read
a
menace
in
the
flickering
of
the
firelight
on
the
polished
cabinets
and
the
uneasy
starting
of
the
shadow
on
the
roof.
He
was
ashamed
of
his
relief,
when
Poole
presently
returned
to
announce
that
Dr.
Jekyll
was
gone
out.
“I
saw
Mr.
Hyde
go
in
by
the
old
dissecting
room,
Poole,”
he
said.
“Is
that
right,
when
Dr.
Jekyll
is
from
home?”
“Quite
right,
Mr.
Utterson,
sir,”
replied
the
servant.
“Mr.
Hyde
has
a
key.”
“Your
master
seems
to
repose
a
great
deal
of
trust
in
that
young
man,
Poole,”
resumed
the
other
musingly.
“Yes,
sir,
he
does
indeed,”
said
Poole.
“We
have
all
orders
to
obey
him.”
“I
do
not
think
I
ever
met
Mr.
Hyde?”
asked

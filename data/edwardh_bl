from
my
eyes,
I
ask
myself
if
I
believe
it,
and
I
cannot
answer.
My
life
is
shaken
to
its
roots;
sleep
has
left
me;
the
deadliest
terror
sits
by
me
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night;
and
I
feel
that
my
days
are
numbered,
and
that
I
must
die;
and
yet
I
shall
die
incredulous.
As
for
the
moral
turpitude
that
man
unveiled
to
me,
even
with
tears
of
penitence,
I
can
not,
even
in
memory,
dwell
on
it
without
a
start
of
horror.
I
will
say
but
one
thing,
Utterson,
and
that
(if
you
can
bring
your
mind
to
credit
it)
will
be
more
than
enough.
The
creature
who
crept
into
my
house
that
night
was,
on
Jekyll’s
own
confession,
known
by
the
name
of
Hyde
and
hunted
for
in
every
corner
of
the
land
as
the
murderer
of
Carew.
HASTIE
LANYON
HENRY
JEKYLL’S
FULL
STATEMENT
OF
THE
CASE
I
was
born
in
the
year
18--
to
a
large
fortune,
endowed
besides
with
excellent
parts,
inclined
by
nature
to
industry,
fond
of
the
respect
of
the
wise
and
good
among
my
fellowmen,
and
thus,
as
might
have
been
supposed,
with
every
guarantee
of
an
honourable
and
distinguished
future.
And
indeed
the
worst
of
my
faults
was
a
certain
impatient
gaiety
of
disposition,
such
as
has
made
the
happiness
of
many,
but
such
as
I
found
it
hard
to
reconcile
with
my
imperious
desire
to
carry
my
head
high,
and
wear
a
more
than
commonly
grave
countenance
before
the
public.
Hence
it
came
about
that
I
concealed
my
pleasures;
and
that
when
I
reached
years
of
reflection,
and
began
to
look
round
me
and
take
stock
of
my
progress
and
position
in
the
world,
I
stood
already
committed
to
a
profound
duplicity
of
life.
Many
a
man
would
have
even
blazoned
such
irregularities
as
I
was
guilty
of;
but
from
the
high
views
that
I
had
set
before
me,
I
regarded
and
hid
them
with
an
almost
morbid
sense
of
shame.
It
was
thus
rather
the
exacting
nature
of
my
aspirations
than
any
particular
degradation
in
my
faults,
that
made
me
what
I
was,
and,
with
even
a
deeper
trench
than
in
the
majority
of
men,
severed
in
me
those
provinces
of
good
and
ill
which
divide
and
compound
man’s
dual
nature.
In
this
case,
I
was
driven
to
reflect
deeply
and
inveterately
on
that
hard
law
of
life,
which
lies
at
the
root
of
religion
and
is
one
of
the
most
plentiful
springs
of
distress.
Though
so
profound
a
double-dealer,
I
was
in
no
sense
a
hypocrite;
both
sides
of
me
were
in
dead
earnest;
I
was
no
more
myself
when
I
laid
aside
restraint
and
plunged
in
shame,
than
when
I
laboured,
in
the
eye
of
day,
at
the
furtherance
of
knowledge
or
the
relief
of
sorrow
and
suffering.
And
it
chanced
that
the
direction
of
my
scientific
studies,
which
led
wholly
towards
the
mystic
and
the
transcendental,
reacted
and
shed
a
strong
light
on

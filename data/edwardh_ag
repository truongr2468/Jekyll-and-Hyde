must
be
the
two
oldest
friends
that
Henry
Jekyll
has?”
“I
wish
the
friends
were
younger,”
chuckled
Dr.
Lanyon.
“But
I
suppose
we
are.
And
what
of
that?
I
see
little
of
him
now.”
“Indeed?”
said
Utterson.
“I
thought
you
had
a
bond
of
common
interest.”
“We
had,”
was
the
reply.
“But
it
is
more
than
ten
years
since
Henry
Jekyll
became
too
fanciful
for
me.
He
began
to
go
wrong,
wrong
in
mind;
and
though
of
course
I
continue
to
take
an
interest
in
him
for
old
sake’s
sake,
as
they
say,
I
see
and
I
have
seen
devilish
little
of
the
man.
Such
unscientific
balderdash,”
added
the
doctor,
flushing
suddenly
purple,
“would
have
estranged
Damon
and
Pythias.”
This
little
spirit
of
temper
was
somewhat
of
a
relief
to
Mr.
Utterson.
“They
have
only
differed
on
some
point
of
science,”
he
thought;
and
being
a
man
of
no
scientific
passions
(except
in
the
matter
of
conveyancing),
he
even
added:
“It
is
nothing
worse
than
that!”
He
gave
his
friend
a
few
seconds
to
recover
his
composure,
and
then
approached
the
question
he
had
come
to
put.
“Did
you
ever
come
across
a
protege
of
his--one
Hyde?”
he
asked.
“Hyde?”
repeated
Lanyon.
“No.
Never
heard
of
him.
Since
my
time.”
That
was
the
amount
of
information
that
the
lawyer
carried
back
with
him
to
the
great,
dark
bed
on
which
he
tossed
to
and
fro,
until
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
began
to
grow
large.
It
was
a
night
of
little
ease
to
his
toiling
mind,
toiling
in
mere
darkness
and
beseiged
by
questions.
Six
o’clock
struck
on
the
bells
of
the
church
that
was
so
conveniently
near
to
Mr.
Utterson’s
dwelling,
and
still
he
was
digging
at
the
problem.
Hitherto
it
had
touched
him
on
the
intellectual
side
alone;
but
now
his
imagination
also
was
engaged,
or
rather
enslaved;
and
as
he
lay
and
tossed
in
the
gross
darkness
of
the
night
and
the
curtained
room,
Mr.
Enfield’s
tale
went
by
before
his
mind
in
a
scroll
of
lighted
pictures.
He
would
be
aware
of
the
great
field
of
lamps
of
a
nocturnal
city;
then
of
the
figure
of
a
man
walking
swiftly;
then
of
a
child
running
from
the
doctor’s;
and
then
these
met,
and
that
human
Juggernaut
trod
the
child
down
and
passed
on
regardless
of
her
screams.
Or
else
he
would
see
a
room
in
a
rich
house,
where
his
friend
lay
asleep,
dreaming
and
smiling
at
his
dreams;
and
then
the
door
of
that
room
would
be
opened,
the
curtains
of
the
bed
plucked
apart,
the
sleeper
recalled,
and
lo!
there
would
stand
by
his
side
a
figure
to
whom
power
was
given,
and
even
at
that
dead
hour,
he
must
rise
and
do
its
bidding.
The
figure
in
these
two
phases
haunted
the
lawyer
all
night;
and
if
at
any
time
he
dozed
over,
it
was
but
to
see
it
glide
more
stealthily
through
sleeping
houses,
or
move
the
more
swiftly
and
still

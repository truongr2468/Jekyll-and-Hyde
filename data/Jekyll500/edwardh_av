night
after
the
funeral,
at
which
he
had
been
sadly
affected,
Utterson
locked
the
door
of
his
business
room,
and
sitting
there
by
the
light
of
a
melancholy
candle,
drew
out
and
set
before
him
an
envelope
addressed
by
the
hand
and
sealed
with
the
seal
of
his
dead
friend.
“PRIVATE:
for
the
hands
of
G.
J.
Utterson
ALONE,
and
in
case
of
his
predecease
to
be
destroyed
unread,”
so
it
was
emphatically
superscribed;
and
the
lawyer
dreaded
to
behold
the
contents.
“I
have
buried
one
friend
to-day,”
he
thought:
“what
if
this
should
cost
me
another?”
And
then
he
condemned
the
fear
as
a
disloyalty,
and
broke
the
seal.
Within
there
was
another
enclosure,
likewise
sealed,
and
marked
upon
the
cover
as
“not
to
be
opened
till
the
death
or
disappearance
of
Dr.
Henry
Jekyll.”
Utterson
could
not
trust
his
eyes.
Yes,
it
was
disappearance;
here
again,
as
in
the
mad
will
which
he
had
long
ago
restored
to
its
author,
here
again
were
the
idea
of
a
disappearance
and
the
name
of
Henry
Jekyll
bracketted.
But
in
the
will,
that
idea
had
sprung
from
the
sinister
suggestion
of
the
man
Hyde;
it
was
set
there
with
a
purpose
all
too
plain
and
horrible.
Written
by
the
hand
of
Lanyon,
what
should
it
mean?
A
great
curiosity
came
on
the
trustee,
to
disregard
the
prohibition
and
dive
at
once
to
the
bottom
of
these
mysteries;
but
professional
honour
and
faith
to
his
dead
friend
were
stringent
obligations;
and
the
packet
slept
in
the
inmost
corner
of
his
private
safe.
It
is
one
thing
to
mortify
curiosity,
another
to
conquer
it;
and
it
may
be
doubted
if,
from
that
day
forth,
Utterson
desired
the
society
of
his
surviving
friend
with
the
same
eagerness.
He
thought
of
him
kindly;
but
his
thoughts
were
disquieted
and
fearful.
He
went
to
call
indeed;
but
he
was
perhaps
relieved
to
be
denied
admittance;
perhaps,
in
his
heart,
he
preferred
to
speak
with
Poole
upon
the
doorstep
and
surrounded
by
the
air
and
sounds
of
the
open
city,
rather
than
to
be
admitted
into
that
house
of
voluntary
bondage,
and
to
sit
and
speak
with
its
inscrutable
recluse.
Poole
had,
indeed,
no
very
pleasant
news
to
communicate.
The
doctor,
it
appeared,
now
more
than
ever
confined
himself
to
the
cabinet
over
the
laboratory,
where
he
would
sometimes
even
sleep;
he
was
out
of
spirits,
he
had
grown
very
silent,
he
did
not
read;
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
mind.
Utterson
became
so
used
to
the
unvarying
character
of
these
reports,
that
he
fell
off
little
by
little
in
the
frequency
of
his
visits.
INCIDENT
AT
THE
WINDOW
It
chanced
on
Sunday,
when
Mr.
Utterson
was
on
his
usual
walk
with
Mr.
Enfield,
that
their
way
lay
once
again
through
the
by-street;
and
that
when
they
came
in
front
of
the
door,
both
stopped
to
gaze
on
it.
“Well,”
said
Enfield,
“that
story’s
at
an
end
at
least.
We
shall
never
see

The
power
of
the
drug
had
not
been
always
equally
displayed.
Once,
very
early
in
my
career,
it
had
totally
failed
me;
since
then
I
had
been
obliged
on
more
than
one
occasion
to
double,
and
once,
with
infinite
risk
of
death,
to
treble
the
amount;
and
these
rare
uncertainties
had
cast
hitherto
the
sole
shadow
on
my
contentment.
Now,
however,
and
in
the
light
of
that
morning’s
accident,
I
was
led
to
remark
that
whereas,
in
the
beginning,
the
difficulty
had
been
to
throw
off
the
body
of
Jekyll,
it
had
of
late
gradually
but
decidedly
transferred
itself
to
the
other
side.
All
things
therefore
seemed
to
point
to
this;
that
I
was
slowly
losing
hold
of
my
original
and
better
self,
and
becoming
slowly
incorporated
with
my
second
and
worse.
Between
these
two,
I
now
felt
I
had
to
choose.
My
two
natures
had
memory
in
common,
but
all
other
faculties
were
most
unequally
shared
between
them.
Jekyll
(who
was
composite)
now
with
the
most
sensitive
apprehensions,
now
with
a
greedy
gusto,
projected
and
shared
in
the
pleasures
and
adventures
of
Hyde;
but
Hyde
was
indifferent
to
Jekyll,
or
but
remembered
him
as
the
mountain
bandit
remembers
the
cavern
in
which
he
conceals
himself
from
pursuit.
Jekyll
had
more
than
a
father’s
interest;
Hyde
had
more
than
a
son’s
indifference.
To
cast
in
my
lot
with
Jekyll,
was
to
die
to
those
appetites
which
I
had
long
secretly
indulged
and
had
of
late
begun
to
pamper.
To
cast
it
in
with
Hyde,
was
to
die
to
a
thousand
interests
and
aspirations,
and
to
become,
at
a
blow
and
forever,
despised
and
friendless.
The
bargain
might
appear
unequal;
but
there
was
still
another
consideration
in
the
scales;
for
while
Jekyll
would
suffer
smartingly
in
the
fires
of
abstinence,
Hyde
would
be
not
even
conscious
of
all
that
he
had
lost.
Strange
as
my
circumstances
were,
the
terms
of
this
debate
are
as
old
and
commonplace
as
man;
much
the
same
inducements
and
alarms
cast
the
die
for
any
tempted
and
trembling
sinner;
and
it
fell
out
with
me,
as
it
falls
with
so
vast
a
majority
of
my
fellows,
that
I
chose
the
better
part
and
was
found
wanting
in
the
strength
to
keep
to
it.
Yes,
I
preferred
the
elderly
and
discontented
doctor,
surrounded
by
friends
and
cherishing
honest
hopes;
and
bade
a
resolute
farewell
to
the
liberty,
the
comparative
youth,
the
light
step,
leaping
impulses
and
secret
pleasures,
that
I
had
enjoyed
in
the
disguise
of
Hyde.
I
made
this
choice
perhaps
with
some
unconscious
reservation,
for
I
neither
gave
up
the
house
in
Soho,
nor
destroyed
the
clothes
of
Edward
Hyde,
which
still
lay
ready
in
my
cabinet.
For
two
months,
however,
I
was
true
to
my
determination;
for
two
months,
I
led
a
life
of
such
severity
as
I
had
never
before
attained
to,
and
enjoyed
the
compensations
of
an
approving
conscience.
But
time
began
at
last
to
obliterate
the
freshness
of
my
alarm;
the

in
the
morning,
and
the
first
fog
of
the
season.
A
great
chocolate-coloured
pall
lowered
over
heaven,
but
the
wind
was
continually
charging
and
routing
these
embattled
vapours;
so
that
as
the
cab
crawled
from
street
to
street,
Mr.
Utterson
beheld
a
marvelous
number
of
degrees
and
hues
of
twilight;
for
here
it
would
be
dark
like
the
back-end
of
evening;
and
there
would
be
a
glow
of
a
rich,
lurid
brown,
like
the
light
of
some
strange
conflagration;
and
here,
for
a
moment,
the
fog
would
be
quite
broken
up,
and
a
haggard
shaft
of
daylight
would
glance
in
between
the
swirling
wreaths.
The
dismal
quarter
of
Soho
seen
under
these
changing
glimpses,
with
its
muddy
ways,
and
slatternly
passengers,
and
its
lamps,
which
had
never
been
extinguished
or
had
been
kindled
afresh
to
combat
this
mournful
reinvasion
of
darkness,
seemed,
in
the
lawyer’s
eyes,
like
a
district
of
some
city
in
a
nightmare.
The
thoughts
of
his
mind,
besides,
were
of
the
gloomiest
dye;
and
when
he
glanced
at
the
companion
of
his
drive,
he
was
conscious
of
some
touch
of
that
terror
of
the
law
and
the
law’s
officers,
which
may
at
times
assail
the
most
honest.
As
the
cab
drew
up
before
the
address
indicated,
the
fog
lifted
a
little
and
showed
him
a
dingy
street,
a
gin
palace,
a
low
French
eating
house,
a
shop
for
the
retail
of
penny
numbers
and
twopenny
salads,
many
ragged
children
huddled
in
the
doorways,
and
many
women
of
many
different
nationalities
passing
out,
key
in
hand,
to
have
a
morning
glass;
and
the
next
moment
the
fog
settled
down
again
upon
that
part,
as
brown
as
umber,
and
cut
him
off
from
his
blackguardly
surroundings.
This
was
the
home
of
Henry
Jekyll’s
favourite;
of
a
man
who
was
heir
to
a
quarter
of
a
million
sterling.
An
ivory-faced
and
silvery-haired
old
woman
opened
the
door.
She
had
an
evil
face,
smoothed
by
hypocrisy:
but
her
manners
were
excellent.
Yes,
she
said,
this
was
Mr.
Hyde’s,
but
he
was
not
at
home;
he
had
been
in
that
night
very
late,
but
he
had
gone
away
again
in
less
than
an
hour;
there
was
nothing
strange
in
that;
his
habits
were
very
irregular,
and
he
was
often
absent;
for
instance,
it
was
nearly
two
months
since
she
had
seen
him
till
yesterday.
“Very
well,
then,
we
wish
to
see
his
rooms,”
said
the
lawyer;
and
when
the
woman
began
to
declare
it
was
impossible,
“I
had
better
tell
you
who
this
person
is,”
he
added.
“This
is
Inspector
Newcomen
of
Scotland
Yard.”
A
flash
of
odious
joy
appeared
upon
the
woman’s
face.
“Ah!”
said
she,
“he
is
in
trouble!
What
has
he
done?”
Mr.
Utterson
and
the
inspector
exchanged
glances.
“He
don’t
seem
a
very
popular
character,”
observed
the
latter.
“And
now,
my
good
woman,
just
let
me
and
this
gentleman
have
a
look
about
us.”
In
the
whole
extent
of
the
house,
which
but
for
the
old
woman
remained

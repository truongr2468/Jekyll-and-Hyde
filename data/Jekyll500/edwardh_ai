and
the
look
of
him,
even
at
that
distance,
went
somehow
strongly
against
the
watcher’s
inclination.
But
he
made
straight
for
the
door,
crossing
the
roadway
to
save
time;
and
as
he
came,
he
drew
a
key
from
his
pocket
like
one
approaching
home.
Mr.
Utterson
stepped
out
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
as
he
passed.
“Mr.
Hyde,
I
think?”
Mr.
Hyde
shrank
back
with
a
hissing
intake
of
the
breath.
But
his
fear
was
only
momentary;
and
though
he
did
not
look
the
lawyer
in
the
face,
he
answered
coolly
enough:
“That
is
my
name.
What
do
you
want?”
“I
see
you
are
going
in,”
returned
the
lawyer.
“I
am
an
old
friend
of
Dr.
Jekyll’s--Mr.
Utterson
of
Gaunt
Street--you
must
have
heard
of
my
name;
and
meeting
you
so
conveniently,
I
thought
you
might
admit
me.”
“You
will
not
find
Dr.
Jekyll;
he
is
from
home,”
replied
Mr.
Hyde,
blowing
in
the
key.
And
then
suddenly,
but
still
without
looking
up,
“How
did
you
know
me?”
he
asked.
“On
your
side,”
said
Mr.
Utterson
“will
you
do
me
a
favour?”
“With
pleasure,”
replied
the
other.
“What
shall
it
be?”
“Will
you
let
me
see
your
face?”
asked
the
lawyer.
Mr.
Hyde
appeared
to
hesitate,
and
then,
as
if
upon
some
sudden
reflection,
fronted
about
with
an
air
of
defiance;
and
the
pair
stared
at
each
other
pretty
fixedly
for
a
few
seconds.
“Now
I
shall
know
you
again,”
said
Mr.
Utterson.
“It
may
be
useful.”
“Yes,”
returned
Mr.
Hyde,
“It
is
as
well
we
have
met;
and
apropos,
you
should
have
my
address.”
And
he
gave
a
number
of
a
street
in
Soho.
“Good
God!”
thought
Mr.
Utterson,
“can
he,
too,
have
been
thinking
of
the
will?”
But
he
kept
his
feelings
to
himself
and
only
grunted
in
acknowledgment
of
the
address.
“And
now,”
said
the
other,
“how
did
you
know
me?”
“By
description,”
was
the
reply.
“Whose
description?”
“We
have
common
friends,”
said
Mr.
Utterson.
“Common
friends,”
echoed
Mr.
Hyde,
a
little
hoarsely.
“Who
are
they?”
“Jekyll,
for
instance,”
said
the
lawyer.
“He
never
told
you,”
cried
Mr.
Hyde,
with
a
flush
of
anger.
“I
did
not
think
you
would
have
lied.”
“Come,”
said
Mr.
Utterson,
“that
is
not
fitting
language.”
The
other
snarled
aloud
into
a
savage
laugh;
and
the
next
moment,
with
extraordinary
quickness,
he
had
unlocked
the
door
and
disappeared
into
the
house.
The
lawyer
stood
awhile
when
Mr.
Hyde
had
left
him,
the
picture
of
disquietude.
Then
he
began
slowly
to
mount
the
street,
pausing
every
step
or
two
and
putting
his
hand
to
his
brow
like
a
man
in
mental
perplexity.
The
problem
he
was
thus
debating
as
he
walked,
was
one
of
a
class
that
is
rarely
solved.
Mr.
Hyde
was
pale
and
dwarfish,
he
gave
an
impression
of
deformity
without
any
nameable
malformation,
he
had
a
displeasing
smile,
he
had
borne
himself
to
the
lawyer
with
a
sort
of
murderous
mixture
of
timidity
and
boldness,
and
he
spoke
with

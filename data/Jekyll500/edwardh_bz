to
pace
up
and
down
this
room
(my
last
earthly
refuge)
and
give
ear
to
every
sound
of
menace.
Will
Hyde
die
upon
the
scaffold?
or
will
he
find
courage
to
release
himself
at
the
last
moment?
God
knows;
I
am
careless;
this
is
my
true
hour
of
death,
and
what
is
to
follow
concerns
another
than
myself.
Here
then,
as
I
lay
down
the
pen
and
proceed
to
seal
up
my
confession,
I
bring
the
life
of
that
unhappy
Henry
Jekyll
to
an
end.

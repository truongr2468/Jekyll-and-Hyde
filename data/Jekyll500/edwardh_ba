old.”
“This
is
a
strange
note,”
said
Mr.
Utterson;
and
then
sharply,
“How
do
you
come
to
have
it
open?”
“The
man
at
Maw’s
was
main
angry,
sir,
and
he
threw
it
back
to
me
like
so
much
dirt,”
returned
Poole.
“This
is
unquestionably
the
doctor’s
hand,
do
you
know?”
resumed
the
lawyer.
“I
thought
it
looked
like
it,”
said
the
servant
rather
sulkily;
and
then,
with
another
voice,
“But
what
matters
hand
of
write?”
he
said.
“I’ve
seen
him!”
“Seen
him?”
repeated
Mr.
Utterson.
“Well?”
“That’s
it!”
said
Poole.
“It
was
this
way.
I
came
suddenly
into
the
theatre
from
the
garden.
It
seems
he
had
slipped
out
to
look
for
this
drug
or
whatever
it
is;
for
the
cabinet
door
was
open,
and
there
he
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
digging
among
the
crates.
He
looked
up
when
I
came
in,
gave
a
kind
of
cry,
and
whipped
upstairs
into
the
cabinet.
It
was
but
for
one
minute
that
I
saw
him,
but
the
hair
stood
upon
my
head
like
quills.
Sir,
if
that
was
my
master,
why
had
he
a
mask
upon
his
face?
If
it
was
my
master,
why
did
he
cry
out
like
a
rat,
and
run
from
me?
I
have
served
him
long
enough.
And
then...”
The
man
paused
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
face.
“These
are
all
very
strange
circumstances,”
said
Mr.
Utterson,
“but
I
think
I
begin
to
see
daylight.
Your
master,
Poole,
is
plainly
seized
with
one
of
those
maladies
that
both
torture
and
deform
the
sufferer;
hence,
for
aught
I
know,
the
alteration
of
his
voice;
hence
the
mask
and
the
avoidance
of
his
friends;
hence
his
eagerness
to
find
this
drug,
by
means
of
which
the
poor
soul
retains
some
hope
of
ultimate
recovery--God
grant
that
he
be
not
deceived!
There
is
my
explanation;
it
is
sad
enough,
Poole,
ay,
and
appalling
to
consider;
but
it
is
plain
and
natural,
hangs
well
together,
and
delivers
us
from
all
exorbitant
alarms.”
“Sir,”
said
the
butler,
turning
to
a
sort
of
mottled
pallor,
“that
thing
was
not
my
master,
and
there’s
the
truth.
My
master”--here
he
looked
round
him
and
began
to
whisper--“is
a
tall,
fine
build
of
a
man,
and
this
was
more
of
a
dwarf.”
Utterson
attempted
to
protest.
“O,
sir,”
cried
Poole,
“do
you
think
I
do
not
know
my
master
after
twenty
years?
Do
you
think
I
do
not
know
where
his
head
comes
to
in
the
cabinet
door,
where
I
saw
him
every
morning
of
my
life?
No,
sir,
that
thing
in
the
mask
was
never
Dr.
Jekyll--God
knows
what
it
was,
but
it
was
never
Dr.
Jekyll;
and
it
is
the
belief
of
my
heart
that
there
was
murder
done.”
“Poole,”
replied
the
lawyer,
“if
you
say
that,
it
will
become
my
duty
to
make
certain.
Much
as
I
desire
to
spare
your
master’s
feelings,
much
as
I
am
puzzled
by
this
note
which
seems
to
prove
him
to
be
still

the
more
swiftly,
even
to
dizziness,
through
wider
labyrinths
of
lamplighted
city,
and
at
every
street
corner
crush
a
child
and
leave
her
screaming.
And
still
the
figure
had
no
face
by
which
he
might
know
it;
even
in
his
dreams,
it
had
no
face,
or
one
that
baffled
him
and
melted
before
his
eyes;
and
thus
it
was
that
there
sprang
up
and
grew
apace
in
the
lawyer’s
mind
a
singularly
strong,
almost
an
inordinate,
curiosity
to
behold
the
features
of
the
real
Mr.
Hyde.
If
he
could
but
once
set
eyes
on
him,
he
thought
the
mystery
would
lighten
and
perhaps
roll
altogether
away,
as
was
the
habit
of
mysterious
things
when
well
examined.
He
might
see
a
reason
for
his
friend’s
strange
preference
or
bondage
(call
it
which
you
please)
and
even
for
the
startling
clause
of
the
will.
At
least
it
would
be
a
face
worth
seeing:
the
face
of
a
man
who
was
without
bowels
of
mercy:
a
face
which
had
but
to
show
itself
to
raise
up,
in
the
mind
of
the
unimpressionable
Enfield,
a
spirit
of
enduring
hatred.
From
that
time
forward,
Mr.
Utterson
began
to
haunt
the
door
in
the
by-street
of
shops.
In
the
morning
before
office
hours,
at
noon
when
business
was
plenty,
and
time
scarce,
at
night
under
the
face
of
the
fogged
city
moon,
by
all
lights
and
at
all
hours
of
solitude
or
concourse,
the
lawyer
was
to
be
found
on
his
chosen
post.
“If
he
be
Mr.
Hyde,”
he
had
thought,
“I
shall
be
Mr.
Seek.”
And
at
last
his
patience
was
rewarded.
It
was
a
fine
dry
night;
frost
in
the
air;
the
streets
as
clean
as
a
ballroom
floor;
the
lamps,
unshaken
by
any
wind,
drawing
a
regular
pattern
of
light
and
shadow.
By
ten
o’clock,
when
the
shops
were
closed
the
by-street
was
very
solitary
and,
in
spite
of
the
low
growl
of
London
from
all
round,
very
silent.
Small
sounds
carried
far;
domestic
sounds
out
of
the
houses
were
clearly
audible
on
either
side
of
the
roadway;
and
the
rumour
of
the
approach
of
any
passenger
preceded
him
by
a
long
time.
Mr.
Utterson
had
been
some
minutes
at
his
post,
when
he
was
aware
of
an
odd
light
footstep
drawing
near.
In
the
course
of
his
nightly
patrols,
he
had
long
grown
accustomed
to
the
quaint
effect
with
which
the
footfalls
of
a
single
person,
while
he
is
still
a
great
way
off,
suddenly
spring
out
distinct
from
the
vast
hum
and
clatter
of
the
city.
Yet
his
attention
had
never
before
been
so
sharply
and
decisively
arrested;
and
it
was
with
a
strong,
superstitious
prevision
of
success
that
he
withdrew
into
the
entry
of
the
court.
The
steps
drew
swiftly
nearer,
and
swelled
out
suddenly
louder
as
they
turned
the
end
of
the
street.
The
lawyer,
looking
forth
from
the
entry,
could
soon
see
what
manner
of
man
he
had
to
deal
with.
He
was
small
and
very
plainly
dressed

otherwise
empty,
Mr.
Hyde
had
only
used
a
couple
of
rooms;
but
these
were
furnished
with
luxury
and
good
taste.
A
closet
was
filled
with
wine;
the
plate
was
of
silver,
the
napery
elegant;
a
good
picture
hung
upon
the
walls,
a
gift
(as
Utterson
supposed)
from
Henry
Jekyll,
who
was
much
of
a
connoisseur;
and
the
carpets
were
of
many
plies
and
agreeable
in
colour.
At
this
moment,
however,
the
rooms
bore
every
mark
of
having
been
recently
and
hurriedly
ransacked;
clothes
lay
about
the
floor,
with
their
pockets
inside
out;
lock-fast
drawers
stood
open;
and
on
the
hearth
there
lay
a
pile
of
grey
ashes,
as
though
many
papers
had
been
burned.
From
these
embers
the
inspector
disinterred
the
butt
end
of
a
green
cheque
book,
which
had
resisted
the
action
of
the
fire;
the
other
half
of
the
stick
was
found
behind
the
door;
and
as
this
clinched
his
suspicions,
the
officer
declared
himself
delighted.
A
visit
to
the
bank,
where
several
thousand
pounds
were
found
to
be
lying
to
the
murderer’s
credit,
completed
his
gratification.
“You
may
depend
upon
it,
sir,”
he
told
Mr.
Utterson:
“I
have
him
in
my
hand.
He
must
have
lost
his
head,
or
he
never
would
have
left
the
stick
or,
above
all,
burned
the
cheque
book.
Why,
money’s
life
to
the
man.
We
have
nothing
to
do
but
wait
for
him
at
the
bank,
and
get
out
the
handbills.”
This
last,
however,
was
not
so
easy
of
accomplishment;
for
Mr.
Hyde
had
numbered
few
familiars--even
the
master
of
the
servant
maid
had
only
seen
him
twice;
his
family
could
nowhere
be
traced;
he
had
never
been
photographed;
and
the
few
who
could
describe
him
differed
widely,
as
common
observers
will.
Only
on
one
point
were
they
agreed;
and
that
was
the
haunting
sense
of
unexpressed
deformity
with
which
the
fugitive
impressed
his
beholders.
INCIDENT
OF
THE
LETTER
It
was
late
in
the
afternoon,
when
Mr.
Utterson
found
his
way
to
Dr.
Jekyll’s
door,
where
he
was
at
once
admitted
by
Poole,
and
carried
down
by
the
kitchen
offices
and
across
a
yard
which
had
once
been
a
garden,
to
the
building
which
was
indifferently
known
as
the
laboratory
or
dissecting
rooms.
The
doctor
had
bought
the
house
from
the
heirs
of
a
celebrated
surgeon;
and
his
own
tastes
being
rather
chemical
than
anatomical,
had
changed
the
destination
of
the
block
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden.
It
was
the
first
time
that
the
lawyer
had
been
received
in
that
part
of
his
friend’s
quarters;
and
he
eyed
the
dingy,
windowless
structure
with
curiosity,
and
gazed
round
with
a
distasteful
sense
of
strangeness
as
he
crossed
the
theatre,
once
crowded
with
eager
students
and
now
lying
gaunt
and
silent,
the
tables
laden
with
chemical
apparatus,
the
floor
strewn
with
crates
and
littered
with
packing
straw,
and
the
light
falling
dimly
through
the
foggy
cupola.
At
the
further
end,
a
flight
of
stairs
mounted
to
a
door
covered
with
red
baize;
and

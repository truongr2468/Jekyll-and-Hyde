laying
out
the
surplus
of
their
grains
in
coquetry;
so
that
the
shop
fronts
stood
along
that
thoroughfare
with
an
air
of
invitation,
like
rows
of
smiling
saleswomen.
Even
on
Sunday,
when
it
veiled
its
more
florid
charms
and
lay
comparatively
empty
of
passage,
the
street
shone
out
in
contrast
to
its
dingy
neighbourhood,
like
a
fire
in
a
forest;
and
with
its
freshly
painted
shutters,
well-polished
brasses,
and
general
cleanliness
and
gaiety
of
note,
instantly
caught
and
pleased
the
eye
of
the
passenger.
Two
doors
from
one
corner,
on
the
left
hand
going
east
the
line
was
broken
by
the
entry
of
a
court;
and
just
at
that
point
a
certain
sinister
block
of
building
thrust
forward
its
gable
on
the
street.
It
was
two
storeys
high;
showed
no
window,
nothing
but
a
door
on
the
lower
storey
and
a
blind
forehead
of
discoloured
wall
on
the
upper;
and
bore
in
every
feature,
the
marks
of
prolonged
and
sordid
negligence.
The
door,
which
was
equipped
with
neither
bell
nor
knocker,
was
blistered
and
distained.
Tramps
slouched
into
the
recess
and
struck
matches
on
the
panels;
children
kept
shop
upon
the
steps;
the
schoolboy
had
tried
his
knife
on
the
mouldings;
and
for
close
on
a
generation,
no
one
had
appeared
to
drive
away
these
random
visitors
or
to
repair
their
ravages.
Mr.
Enfield
and
the
lawyer
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
by-street;
but
when
they
came
abreast
of
the
entry,
the
former
lifted
up
his
cane
and
pointed.
“Did
you
ever
remark
that
door?”
he
asked;
and
when
his
companion
had
replied
in
the
affirmative.
“It
is
connected
in
my
mind,”
added
he,
“with
a
very
odd
story.”
“Indeed?”
said
Mr.
Utterson,
with
a
slight
change
of
voice,
“and
what
was
that?”
“Well,
it
was
this
way,”
returned
Mr.
Enfield:
“I
was
coming
home
from
some
place
at
the
end
of
the
world,
about
three
o’clock
of
a
black
winter
morning,
and
my
way
lay
through
a
part
of
town
where
there
was
literally
nothing
to
be
seen
but
lamps.
Street
after
street
and
all
the
folks
asleep--street
after
street,
all
lighted
up
as
if
for
a
procession
and
all
as
empty
as
a
church--till
at
last
I
got
into
that
state
of
mind
when
a
man
listens
and
listens
and
begins
to
long
for
the
sight
of
a
policeman.
All
at
once,
I
saw
two
figures:
one
a
little
man
who
was
stumping
along
eastward
at
a
good
walk,
and
the
other
a
girl
of
maybe
eight
or
ten
who
was
running
as
hard
as
she
was
able
down
a
cross
street.
Well,
sir,
the
two
ran
into
one
another
naturally
enough
at
the
corner;
and
then
came
the
horrible
part
of
the
thing;
for
the
man
trampled
calmly
over
the
child’s
body
and
left
her
screaming
on
the
ground.
It
sounds
nothing
to
hear,
but
it
was
hellish
to
see.
It
wasn’t
like
a
man;
it
was
like
some
damned
Juggernaut.
I
gave

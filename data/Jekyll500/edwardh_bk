was
at
first
of
a
reddish
hue,
began,
in
proportion
as
the
crystals
melted,
to
brighten
in
colour,
to
effervesce
audibly,
and
to
throw
off
small
fumes
of
vapour.
Suddenly
and
at
the
same
moment,
the
ebullition
ceased
and
the
compound
changed
to
a
dark
purple,
which
faded
again
more
slowly
to
a
watery
green.
My
visitor,
who
had
watched
these
metamorphoses
with
a
keen
eye,
smiled,
set
down
the
glass
upon
the
table,
and
then
turned
and
looked
upon
me
with
an
air
of
scrutiny.
“And
now,”
said
he,
“to
settle
what
remains.
Will
you
be
wise?
will
you
be
guided?
will
you
suffer
me
to
take
this
glass
in
my
hand
and
to
go
forth
from
your
house
without
further
parley?
or
has
the
greed
of
curiosity
too
much
command
of
you?
Think
before
you
answer,
for
it
shall
be
done
as
you
decide.
As
you
decide,
you
shall
be
left
as
you
were
before,
and
neither
richer
nor
wiser,
unless
the
sense
of
service
rendered
to
a
man
in
mortal
distress
may
be
counted
as
a
kind
of
riches
of
the
soul.
Or,
if
you
shall
so
prefer
to
choose,
a
new
province
of
knowledge
and
new
avenues
to
fame
and
power
shall
be
laid
open
to
you,
here,
in
this
room,
upon
the
instant;
and
your
sight
shall
be
blasted
by
a
prodigy
to
stagger
the
unbelief
of
Satan.”
“Sir,”
said
I,
affecting
a
coolness
that
I
was
far
from
truly
possessing,
“you
speak
enigmas,
and
you
will
perhaps
not
wonder
that
I
hear
you
with
no
very
strong
impression
of
belief.
But
I
have
gone
too
far
in
the
way
of
inexplicable
services
to
pause
before
I
see
the
end.”
“It
is
well,”
replied
my
visitor.
“Lanyon,
you
remember
your
vows:
what
follows
is
under
the
seal
of
our
profession.
And
now,
you
who
have
so
long
been
bound
to
the
most
narrow
and
material
views,
you
who
have
denied
the
virtue
of
transcendental
medicine,
you
who
have
derided
your
superiors--behold!”
He
put
the
glass
to
his
lips
and
drank
at
one
gulp.
A
cry
followed;
he
reeled,
staggered,
clutched
at
the
table
and
held
on,
staring
with
injected
eyes,
gasping
with
open
mouth;
and
as
I
looked
there
came,
I
thought,
a
change--he
seemed
to
swell--his
face
became
suddenly
black
and
the
features
seemed
to
melt
and
alter--and
the
next
moment,
I
had
sprung
to
my
feet
and
leaped
back
against
the
wall,
my
arms
raised
to
shield
me
from
that
prodigy,
my
mind
submerged
in
terror.
“O
God!”
I
screamed,
and
“O
God!”
again
and
again;
for
there
before
my
eyes--pale
and
shaken,
and
half
fainting,
and
groping
before
him
with
his
hands,
like
a
man
restored
from
death--there
stood
Henry
Jekyll!
What
he
told
me
in
the
next
hour,
I
cannot
bring
my
mind
to
set
on
paper.
I
saw
what
I
saw,
I
heard
what
I
heard,
and
my
soul
sickened
at
it;
and
yet
now
when
that
sight
has
faded

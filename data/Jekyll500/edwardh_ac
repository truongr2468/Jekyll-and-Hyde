halloa,
took
to
my
heels,
collared
my
gentleman,
and
brought
him
back
to
where
there
was
already
quite
a
group
about
the
screaming
child.
He
was
perfectly
cool
and
made
no
resistance,
but
gave
me
one
look,
so
ugly
that
it
brought
out
the
sweat
on
me
like
running.
The
people
who
had
turned
out
were
the
girl’s
own
family;
and
pretty
soon,
the
doctor,
for
whom
she
had
been
sent
put
in
his
appearance.
Well,
the
child
was
not
much
the
worse,
more
frightened,
according
to
the
Sawbones;
and
there
you
might
have
supposed
would
be
an
end
to
it.
But
there
was
one
curious
circumstance.
I
had
taken
a
loathing
to
my
gentleman
at
first
sight.
So
had
the
child’s
family,
which
was
only
natural.
But
the
doctor’s
case
was
what
struck
me.
He
was
the
usual
cut
and
dry
apothecary,
of
no
particular
age
and
colour,
with
a
strong
Edinburgh
accent
and
about
as
emotional
as
a
bagpipe.
Well,
sir,
he
was
like
the
rest
of
us;
every
time
he
looked
at
my
prisoner,
I
saw
that
Sawbones
turn
sick
and
white
with
desire
to
kill
him.
I
knew
what
was
in
his
mind,
just
as
he
knew
what
was
in
mine;
and
killing
being
out
of
the
question,
we
did
the
next
best.
We
told
the
man
we
could
and
would
make
such
a
scandal
out
of
this
as
should
make
his
name
stink
from
one
end
of
London
to
the
other.
If
he
had
any
friends
or
any
credit,
we
undertook
that
he
should
lose
them.
And
all
the
time,
as
we
were
pitching
it
in
red
hot,
we
were
keeping
the
women
off
him
as
best
we
could
for
they
were
as
wild
as
harpies.
I
never
saw
a
circle
of
such
hateful
faces;
and
there
was
the
man
in
the
middle,
with
a
kind
of
black
sneering
coolness--frightened
too,
I
could
see
that--but
carrying
it
off,
sir,
really
like
Satan.
`If
you
choose
to
make
capital
out
of
this
accident,’
said
he,
`I
am
naturally
helpless.
No
gentleman
but
wishes
to
avoid
a
scene,’
says
he.
`Name
your
figure.’
Well,
we
screwed
him
up
to
a
hundred
pounds
for
the
child’s
family;
he
would
have
clearly
liked
to
stick
out;
but
there
was
something
about
the
lot
of
us
that
meant
mischief,
and
at
last
he
struck.
The
next
thing
was
to
get
the
money;
and
where
do
you
think
he
carried
us
but
to
that
place
with
the
door?--whipped
out
a
key,
went
in,
and
presently
came
back
with
the
matter
of
ten
pounds
in
gold
and
a
cheque
for
the
balance
on
Coutts’s,
drawn
payable
to
bearer
and
signed
with
a
name
that
I
can’t
mention,
though
it’s
one
of
the
points
of
my
story,
but
it
was
a
name
at
least
very
well
known
and
often
printed.
The
figure
was
stiff;
but
the
signature
was
good
for
more
than
that
if
it
was
only
genuine.
I
took
the
liberty
of

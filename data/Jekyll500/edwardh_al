perhaps,
but
every
mark
of
capacity
and
kindness--you
could
see
by
his
looks
that
he
cherished
for
Mr.
Utterson
a
sincere
and
warm
affection.
“I
have
been
wanting
to
speak
to
you,
Jekyll,”
began
the
latter.
“You
know
that
will
of
yours?”
A
close
observer
might
have
gathered
that
the
topic
was
distasteful;
but
the
doctor
carried
it
off
gaily.
“My
poor
Utterson,”
said
he,
“you
are
unfortunate
in
such
a
client.
I
never
saw
a
man
so
distressed
as
you
were
by
my
will;
unless
it
were
that
hide-bound
pedant,
Lanyon,
at
what
he
called
my
scientific
heresies.
O,
I
know
he’s
a
good
fellow--you
needn’t
frown--an
excellent
fellow,
and
I
always
mean
to
see
more
of
him;
but
a
hide-bound
pedant
for
all
that;
an
ignorant,
blatant
pedant.
I
was
never
more
disappointed
in
any
man
than
Lanyon.”
“You
know
I
never
approved
of
it,”
pursued
Utterson,
ruthlessly
disregarding
the
fresh
topic.
“My
will?
Yes,
certainly,
I
know
that,”
said
the
doctor,
a
trifle
sharply.
“You
have
told
me
so.”
“Well,
I
tell
you
so
again,”
continued
the
lawyer.
“I
have
been
learning
something
of
young
Hyde.”
The
large
handsome
face
of
Dr.
Jekyll
grew
pale
to
the
very
lips,
and
there
came
a
blackness
about
his
eyes.
“I
do
not
care
to
hear
more,”
said
he.
“This
is
a
matter
I
thought
we
had
agreed
to
drop.”
“What
I
heard
was
abominable,”
said
Utterson.
“It
can
make
no
change.
You
do
not
understand
my
position,”
returned
the
doctor,
with
a
certain
incoherency
of
manner.
“I
am
painfully
situated,
Utterson;
my
position
is
a
very
strange--a
very
strange
one.
It
is
one
of
those
affairs
that
cannot
be
mended
by
talking.”
“Jekyll,”
said
Utterson,
“you
know
me:
I
am
a
man
to
be
trusted.
Make
a
clean
breast
of
this
in
confidence;
and
I
make
no
doubt
I
can
get
you
out
of
it.”
“My
good
Utterson,”
said
the
doctor,
“this
is
very
good
of
you,
this
is
downright
good
of
you,
and
I
cannot
find
words
to
thank
you
in.
I
believe
you
fully;
I
would
trust
you
before
any
man
alive,
ay,
before
myself,
if
I
could
make
the
choice;
but
indeed
it
isn’t
what
you
fancy;
it
is
not
as
bad
as
that;
and
just
to
put
your
good
heart
at
rest,
I
will
tell
you
one
thing:
the
moment
I
choose,
I
can
be
rid
of
Mr.
Hyde.
I
give
you
my
hand
upon
that;
and
I
thank
you
again
and
again;
and
I
will
just
add
one
little
word,
Utterson,
that
I’m
sure
you’ll
take
in
good
part:
this
is
a
private
matter,
and
I
beg
of
you
to
let
it
sleep.”
Utterson
reflected
a
little,
looking
in
the
fire.
“I
have
no
doubt
you
are
perfectly
right,”
he
said
at
last,
getting
to
his
feet.
“Well,
but
since
we
have
touched
upon
this
business,
and
for
the
last
time
I
hope,”
continued
the
doctor,
“there
is
one
point
I
should
like
you

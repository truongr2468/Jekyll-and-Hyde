through
this,
Mr.
Utterson
was
at
last
received
into
the
doctor’s
cabinet.
It
was
a
large
room
fitted
round
with
glass
presses,
furnished,
among
other
things,
with
a
cheval-glass
and
a
business
table,
and
looking
out
upon
the
court
by
three
dusty
windows
barred
with
iron.
The
fire
burned
in
the
grate;
a
lamp
was
set
lighted
on
the
chimney
shelf,
for
even
in
the
houses
the
fog
began
to
lie
thickly;
and
there,
close
up
to
the
warmth,
sat
Dr.
Jekyll,
looking
deathly
sick.
He
did
not
rise
to
meet
his
visitor,
but
held
out
a
cold
hand
and
bade
him
welcome
in
a
changed
voice.
“And
now,”
said
Mr.
Utterson,
as
soon
as
Poole
had
left
them,
“you
have
heard
the
news?”
The
doctor
shuddered.
“They
were
crying
it
in
the
square,”
he
said.
“I
heard
them
in
my
dining-room.”
“One
word,”
said
the
lawyer.
“Carew
was
my
client,
but
so
are
you,
and
I
want
to
know
what
I
am
doing.
You
have
not
been
mad
enough
to
hide
this
fellow?”
“Utterson,
I
swear
to
God,”
cried
the
doctor,
“I
swear
to
God
I
will
never
set
eyes
on
him
again.
I
bind
my
honour
to
you
that
I
am
done
with
him
in
this
world.
It
is
all
at
an
end.
And
indeed
he
does
not
want
my
help;
you
do
not
know
him
as
I
do;
he
is
safe,
he
is
quite
safe;
mark
my
words,
he
will
never
more
be
heard
of.”
The
lawyer
listened
gloomily;
he
did
not
like
his
friend’s
feverish
manner.
“You
seem
pretty
sure
of
him,”
said
he;
“and
for
your
sake,
I
hope
you
may
be
right.
If
it
came
to
a
trial,
your
name
might
appear.”
“I
am
quite
sure
of
him,”
replied
Jekyll;
“I
have
grounds
for
certainty
that
I
cannot
share
with
any
one.
But
there
is
one
thing
on
which
you
may
advise
me.
I
have--I
have
received
a
letter;
and
I
am
at
a
loss
whether
I
should
show
it
to
the
police.
I
should
like
to
leave
it
in
your
hands,
Utterson;
you
would
judge
wisely,
I
am
sure;
I
have
so
great
a
trust
in
you.”
“You
fear,
I
suppose,
that
it
might
lead
to
his
detection?”
asked
the
lawyer.
“No,”
said
the
other.
“I
cannot
say
that
I
care
what
becomes
of
Hyde;
I
am
quite
done
with
him.
I
was
thinking
of
my
own
character,
which
this
hateful
business
has
rather
exposed.”
Utterson
ruminated
awhile;
he
was
surprised
at
his
friend’s
selfishness,
and
yet
relieved
by
it.
“Well,”
said
he,
at
last,
“let
me
see
the
letter.”
The
letter
was
written
in
an
odd,
upright
hand
and
signed
“Edward
Hyde”:
and
it
signified,
briefly
enough,
that
the
writer’s
benefactor,
Dr.
Jekyll,
whom
he
had
long
so
unworthily
repaid
for
a
thousand
generosities,
need
labour
under
no
alarm
for
his
safety,
as
he
had
means
of
escape
on
which
he
placed
a
sure
dependence.
The
lawyer
liked
this
letter
well
enough;

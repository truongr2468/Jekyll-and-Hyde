breakfast,
drinking
the
chill
of
the
air
with
pleasure,
when
I
was
seized
again
with
those
indescribable
sensations
that
heralded
the
change;
and
I
had
but
the
time
to
gain
the
shelter
of
my
cabinet,
before
I
was
once
again
raging
and
freezing
with
the
passions
of
Hyde.
It
took
on
this
occasion
a
double
dose
to
recall
me
to
myself;
and
alas!
six
hours
after,
as
I
sat
looking
sadly
in
the
fire,
the
pangs
returned,
and
the
drug
had
to
be
re-administered.
In
short,
from
that
day
forth
it
seemed
only
by
a
great
effort
as
of
gymnastics,
and
only
under
the
immediate
stimulation
of
the
drug,
that
I
was
able
to
wear
the
countenance
of
Jekyll.
At
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night,
I
would
be
taken
with
the
premonitory
shudder;
above
all,
if
I
slept,
or
even
dozed
for
a
moment
in
my
chair,
it
was
always
as
Hyde
that
I
awakened.
Under
the
strain
of
this
continually
impending
doom
and
by
the
sleeplessness
to
which
I
now
condemned
myself,
ay,
even
beyond
what
I
had
thought
possible
to
man,
I
became,
in
my
own
person,
a
creature
eaten
up
and
emptied
by
fever,
languidly
weak
both
in
body
and
mind,
and
solely
occupied
by
one
thought:
the
horror
of
my
other
self.
But
when
I
slept,
or
when
the
virtue
of
the
medicine
wore
off,
I
would
leap
almost
without
transition
(for
the
pangs
of
transformation
grew
daily
less
marked)
into
the
possession
of
a
fancy
brimming
with
images
of
terror,
a
soul
boiling
with
causeless
hatreds,
and
a
body
that
seemed
not
strong
enough
to
contain
the
raging
energies
of
life.
The
powers
of
Hyde
seemed
to
have
grown
with
the
sickliness
of
Jekyll.
And
certainly
the
hate
that
now
divided
them
was
equal
on
each
side.
With
Jekyll,
it
was
a
thing
of
vital
instinct.
He
had
now
seen
the
full
deformity
of
that
creature
that
shared
with
him
some
of
the
phenomena
of
consciousness,
and
was
co-heir
with
him
to
death:
and
beyond
these
links
of
community,
which
in
themselves
made
the
most
poignant
part
of
his
distress,
he
thought
of
Hyde,
for
all
his
energy
of
life,
as
of
something
not
only
hellish
but
inorganic.
This
was
the
shocking
thing;
that
the
slime
of
the
pit
seemed
to
utter
cries
and
voices;
that
the
amorphous
dust
gesticulated
and
sinned;
that
what
was
dead,
and
had
no
shape,
should
usurp
the
offices
of
life.
And
this
again,
that
that
insurgent
horror
was
knit
to
him
closer
than
a
wife,
closer
than
an
eye;
lay
caged
in
his
flesh,
where
he
heard
it
mutter
and
felt
it
struggle
to
be
born;
and
at
every
hour
of
weakness,
and
in
the
confidence
of
slumber,
prevailed
against
him,
and
deposed
him
out
of
life.
The
hatred
of
Hyde
for
Jekyll
was
of
a
different
order.
His
terror
of
the
gallows
drove
him
continually
to
commit
temporary
suicide,
and
return
to
his
subordinate
station
of

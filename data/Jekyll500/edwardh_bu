my
professional
life,
to
arrive
again
and
again,
with
the
same
sense
of
unreality,
at
the
damned
horrors
of
the
evening.
I
could
have
screamed
aloud;
I
sought
with
tears
and
prayers
to
smother
down
the
crowd
of
hideous
images
and
sounds
with
which
my
memory
swarmed
against
me;
and
still,
between
the
petitions,
the
ugly
face
of
my
iniquity
stared
into
my
soul.
As
the
acuteness
of
this
remorse
began
to
die
away,
it
was
succeeded
by
a
sense
of
joy.
The
problem
of
my
conduct
was
solved.
Hyde
was
thenceforth
impossible;
whether
I
would
or
not,
I
was
now
confined
to
the
better
part
of
my
existence;
and
O,
how
I
rejoiced
to
think
of
it!
with
what
willing
humility
I
embraced
anew
the
restrictions
of
natural
life!
with
what
sincere
renunciation
I
locked
the
door
by
which
I
had
so
often
gone
and
come,
and
ground
the
key
under
my
heel!
The
next
day,
came
the
news
that
the
murder
had
not
been
overlooked,
that
the
guilt
of
Hyde
was
patent
to
the
world,
and
that
the
victim
was
a
man
high
in
public
estimation.
It
was
not
only
a
crime,
it
had
been
a
tragic
folly.
I
think
I
was
glad
to
know
it;
I
think
I
was
glad
to
have
my
better
impulses
thus
buttressed
and
guarded
by
the
terrors
of
the
scaffold.
Jekyll
was
now
my
city
of
refuge;
let
but
Hyde
peep
out
an
instant,
and
the
hands
of
all
men
would
be
raised
to
take
and
slay
him.
I
resolved
in
my
future
conduct
to
redeem
the
past;
and
I
can
say
with
honesty
that
my
resolve
was
fruitful
of
some
good.
You
know
yourself
how
earnestly,
in
the
last
months
of
the
last
year,
I
laboured
to
relieve
suffering;
you
know
that
much
was
done
for
others,
and
that
the
days
passed
quietly,
almost
happily
for
myself.
Nor
can
I
truly
say
that
I
wearied
of
this
beneficent
and
innocent
life;
I
think
instead
that
I
daily
enjoyed
it
more
completely;
but
I
was
still
cursed
with
my
duality
of
purpose;
and
as
the
first
edge
of
my
penitence
wore
off,
the
lower
side
of
me,
so
long
indulged,
so
recently
chained
down,
began
to
growl
for
licence.
Not
that
I
dreamed
of
resuscitating
Hyde;
the
bare
idea
of
that
would
startle
me
to
frenzy:
no,
it
was
in
my
own
person
that
I
was
once
more
tempted
to
trifle
with
my
conscience;
and
it
was
as
an
ordinary
secret
sinner
that
I
at
last
fell
before
the
assaults
of
temptation.
There
comes
an
end
to
all
things;
the
most
capacious
measure
is
filled
at
last;
and
this
brief
condescension
to
my
evil
finally
destroyed
the
balance
of
my
soul.
And
yet
I
was
not
alarmed;
the
fall
seemed
natural,
like
a
return
to
the
old
days
before
I
had
made
my
discovery.
It
was
a
fine,
clear,
January
day,
wet
under
foot
where
the
frost
had
melted,
but
cloudless
overhead;

this
consciousness
of
the
perennial
war
among
my
members.
With
every
day,
and
from
both
sides
of
my
intelligence,
the
moral
and
the
intellectual,
I
thus
drew
steadily
nearer
to
that
truth,
by
whose
partial
discovery
I
have
been
doomed
to
such
a
dreadful
shipwreck:
that
man
is
not
truly
one,
but
truly
two.
I
say
two,
because
the
state
of
my
own
knowledge
does
not
pass
beyond
that
point.
Others
will
follow,
others
will
outstrip
me
on
the
same
lines;
and
I
hazard
the
guess
that
man
will
be
ultimately
known
for
a
mere
polity
of
multifarious,
incongruous
and
independent
denizens.
I,
for
my
part,
from
the
nature
of
my
life,
advanced
infallibly
in
one
direction
and
in
one
direction
only.
It
was
on
the
moral
side,
and
in
my
own
person,
that
I
learned
to
recognise
the
thorough
and
primitive
duality
of
man;
I
saw
that,
of
the
two
natures
that
contended
in
the
field
of
my
consciousness,
even
if
I
could
rightly
be
said
to
be
either,
it
was
only
because
I
was
radically
both;
and
from
an
early
date,
even
before
the
course
of
my
scientific
discoveries
had
begun
to
suggest
the
most
naked
possibility
of
such
a
miracle,
I
had
learned
to
dwell
with
pleasure,
as
a
beloved
daydream,
on
the
thought
of
the
separation
of
these
elements.
If
each,
I
told
myself,
could
be
housed
in
separate
identities,
life
would
be
relieved
of
all
that
was
unbearable;
the
unjust
might
go
his
way,
delivered
from
the
aspirations
and
remorse
of
his
more
upright
twin;
and
the
just
could
walk
steadfastly
and
securely
on
his
upward
path,
doing
the
good
things
in
which
he
found
his
pleasure,
and
no
longer
exposed
to
disgrace
and
penitence
by
the
hands
of
this
extraneous
evil.
It
was
the
curse
of
mankind
that
these
incongruous
faggots
were
thus
bound
together--that
in
the
agonised
womb
of
consciousness,
these
polar
twins
should
be
continuously
struggling.
How,
then
were
they
dissociated?
I
was
so
far
in
my
reflections
when,
as
I
have
said,
a
side
light
began
to
shine
upon
the
subject
from
the
laboratory
table.
I
began
to
perceive
more
deeply
than
it
has
ever
yet
been
stated,
the
trembling
immateriality,
the
mistlike
transience,
of
this
seemingly
so
solid
body
in
which
we
walk
attired.
Certain
agents
I
found
to
have
the
power
to
shake
and
pluck
back
that
fleshly
vestment,
even
as
a
wind
might
toss
the
curtains
of
a
pavilion.
For
two
good
reasons,
I
will
not
enter
deeply
into
this
scientific
branch
of
my
confession.
First,
because
I
have
been
made
to
learn
that
the
doom
and
burthen
of
our
life
is
bound
for
ever
on
manâ€™s
shoulders,
and
when
the
attempt
is
made
to
cast
it
off,
it
but
returns
upon
us
with
more
unfamiliar
and
more
awful
pressure.
Second,
because,
as
my
narrative
will
make,
alas!
too
evident,
my
discoveries
were
incomplete.
Enough
then,
that
I
not
only
recognised
my
natural
body
from
the
mere
aura

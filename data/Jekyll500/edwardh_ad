pointing
out
to
my
gentleman
that
the
whole
business
looked
apocryphal,
and
that
a
man
does
not,
in
real
life,
walk
into
a
cellar
door
at
four
in
the
morning
and
come
out
with
another
man’s
cheque
for
close
upon
a
hundred
pounds.
But
he
was
quite
easy
and
sneering.
`Set
your
mind
at
rest,’
says
he,
`I
will
stay
with
you
till
the
banks
open
and
cash
the
cheque
myself.’
So
we
all
set
off,
the
doctor,
and
the
child’s
father,
and
our
friend
and
myself,
and
passed
the
rest
of
the
night
in
my
chambers;
and
next
day,
when
we
had
breakfasted,
went
in
a
body
to
the
bank.
I
gave
in
the
cheque
myself,
and
said
I
had
every
reason
to
believe
it
was
a
forgery.
Not
a
bit
of
it.
The
cheque
was
genuine.”
“Tut-tut,”
said
Mr.
Utterson.
“I
see
you
feel
as
I
do,”
said
Mr.
Enfield.
“Yes,
it’s
a
bad
story.
For
my
man
was
a
fellow
that
nobody
could
have
to
do
with,
a
really
damnable
man;
and
the
person
that
drew
the
cheque
is
the
very
pink
of
the
proprieties,
celebrated
too,
and
(what
makes
it
worse)
one
of
your
fellows
who
do
what
they
call
good.
Black
mail
I
suppose;
an
honest
man
paying
through
the
nose
for
some
of
the
capers
of
his
youth.
Black
Mail
House
is
what
I
call
the
place
with
the
door,
in
consequence.
Though
even
that,
you
know,
is
far
from
explaining
all,”
he
added,
and
with
the
words
fell
into
a
vein
of
musing.
From
this
he
was
recalled
by
Mr.
Utterson
asking
rather
suddenly:
“And
you
don’t
know
if
the
drawer
of
the
cheque
lives
there?”
“A
likely
place,
isn’t
it?”
returned
Mr.
Enfield.
“But
I
happen
to
have
noticed
his
address;
he
lives
in
some
square
or
other.”
“And
you
never
asked
about
the--place
with
the
door?”
said
Mr.
Utterson.
“No,
sir:
I
had
a
delicacy,”
was
the
reply.
“I
feel
very
strongly
about
putting
questions;
it
partakes
too
much
of
the
style
of
the
day
of
judgment.
You
start
a
question,
and
it’s
like
starting
a
stone.
You
sit
quietly
on
the
top
of
a
hill;
and
away
the
stone
goes,
starting
others;
and
presently
some
bland
old
bird
(the
last
you
would
have
thought
of)
is
knocked
on
the
head
in
his
own
back
garden
and
the
family
have
to
change
their
name.
No
sir,
I
make
it
a
rule
of
mine:
the
more
it
looks
like
Queer
Street,
the
less
I
ask.”
“A
very
good
rule,
too,”
said
the
lawyer.
“But
I
have
studied
the
place
for
myself,”
continued
Mr.
Enfield.
“It
seems
scarcely
a
house.
There
is
no
other
door,
and
nobody
goes
in
or
out
of
that
one
but,
once
in
a
great
while,
the
gentleman
of
my
adventure.
There
are
three
windows
looking
on
the
court
on
the
first
floor;
none
below;
the
windows
are
always
shut
but
they’re
clean.
And
then
there
is
a
chimney

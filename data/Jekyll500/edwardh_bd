leaped
against
the
lock
and
hinges.
A
dismal
screech,
as
of
mere
animal
terror,
rang
from
the
cabinet.
Up
went
the
axe
again,
and
again
the
panels
crashed
and
the
frame
bounded;
four
times
the
blow
fell;
but
the
wood
was
tough
and
the
fittings
were
of
excellent
workmanship;
and
it
was
not
until
the
fifth,
that
the
lock
burst
and
the
wreck
of
the
door
fell
inwards
on
the
carpet.
The
besiegers,
appalled
by
their
own
riot
and
the
stillness
that
had
succeeded,
stood
back
a
little
and
peered
in.
There
lay
the
cabinet
before
their
eyes
in
the
quiet
lamplight,
a
good
fire
glowing
and
chattering
on
the
hearth,
the
kettle
singing
its
thin
strain,
a
drawer
or
two
open,
papers
neatly
set
forth
on
the
business
table,
and
nearer
the
fire,
the
things
laid
out
for
tea;
the
quietest
room,
you
would
have
said,
and,
but
for
the
glazed
presses
full
of
chemicals,
the
most
commonplace
that
night
in
London.
Right
in
the
middle
there
lay
the
body
of
a
man
sorely
contorted
and
still
twitching.
They
drew
near
on
tiptoe,
turned
it
on
its
back
and
beheld
the
face
of
Edward
Hyde.
He
was
dressed
in
clothes
far
too
large
for
him,
clothes
of
the
doctor’s
bigness;
the
cords
of
his
face
still
moved
with
a
semblance
of
life,
but
life
was
quite
gone:
and
by
the
crushed
phial
in
the
hand
and
the
strong
smell
of
kernels
that
hung
upon
the
air,
Utterson
knew
that
he
was
looking
on
the
body
of
a
self-destroyer.
“We
have
come
too
late,”
he
said
sternly,
“whether
to
save
or
punish.
Hyde
is
gone
to
his
account;
and
it
only
remains
for
us
to
find
the
body
of
your
master.”
The
far
greater
proportion
of
the
building
was
occupied
by
the
theatre,
which
filled
almost
the
whole
ground
storey
and
was
lighted
from
above,
and
by
the
cabinet,
which
formed
an
upper
story
at
one
end
and
looked
upon
the
court.
A
corridor
joined
the
theatre
to
the
door
on
the
by-street;
and
with
this
the
cabinet
communicated
separately
by
a
second
flight
of
stairs.
There
were
besides
a
few
dark
closets
and
a
spacious
cellar.
All
these
they
now
thoroughly
examined.
Each
closet
needed
but
a
glance,
for
all
were
empty,
and
all,
by
the
dust
that
fell
from
their
doors,
had
stood
long
unopened.
The
cellar,
indeed,
was
filled
with
crazy
lumber,
mostly
dating
from
the
times
of
the
surgeon
who
was
Jekyll’s
predecessor;
but
even
as
they
opened
the
door
they
were
advertised
of
the
uselessness
of
further
search,
by
the
fall
of
a
perfect
mat
of
cobweb
which
had
for
years
sealed
up
the
entrance.
No
where
was
there
any
trace
of
Henry
Jekyll
dead
or
alive.
Poole
stamped
on
the
flags
of
the
corridor.
“He
must
be
buried
here,”
he
said,
hearkening
to
the
sound.
“Or
he
may
have
fled,”
said
Utterson,
and
he
turned
to
examine
the
door
in
the
by-street.
It
was

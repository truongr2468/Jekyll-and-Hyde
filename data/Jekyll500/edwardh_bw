dragged
him
from
his
perch.
At
the
inn,
as
I
entered,
I
looked
about
me
with
so
black
a
countenance
as
made
the
attendants
tremble;
not
a
look
did
they
exchange
in
my
presence;
but
obsequiously
took
my
orders,
led
me
to
a
private
room,
and
brought
me
wherewithal
to
write.
Hyde
in
danger
of
his
life
was
a
creature
new
to
me;
shaken
with
inordinate
anger,
strung
to
the
pitch
of
murder,
lusting
to
inflict
pain.
Yet
the
creature
was
astute;
mastered
his
fury
with
a
great
effort
of
the
will;
composed
his
two
important
letters,
one
to
Lanyon
and
one
to
Poole;
and
that
he
might
receive
actual
evidence
of
their
being
posted,
sent
them
out
with
directions
that
they
should
be
registered.
Thenceforward,
he
sat
all
day
over
the
fire
in
the
private
room,
gnawing
his
nails;
there
he
dined,
sitting
alone
with
his
fears,
the
waiter
visibly
quailing
before
his
eye;
and
thence,
when
the
night
was
fully
come,
he
set
forth
in
the
corner
of
a
closed
cab,
and
was
driven
to
and
fro
about
the
streets
of
the
city.
He,
I
say--I
cannot
say,
I.
That
child
of
Hell
had
nothing
human;
nothing
lived
in
him
but
fear
and
hatred.
And
when
at
last,
thinking
the
driver
had
begun
to
grow
suspicious,
he
discharged
the
cab
and
ventured
on
foot,
attired
in
his
misfitting
clothes,
an
object
marked
out
for
observation,
into
the
midst
of
the
nocturnal
passengers,
these
two
base
passions
raged
within
him
like
a
tempest.
He
walked
fast,
hunted
by
his
fears,
chattering
to
himself,
skulking
through
the
less
frequented
thoroughfares,
counting
the
minutes
that
still
divided
him
from
midnight.
Once
a
woman
spoke
to
him,
offering,
I
think,
a
box
of
lights.
He
smote
her
in
the
face,
and
she
fled.
When
I
came
to
myself
at
Lanyon’s,
the
horror
of
my
old
friend
perhaps
affected
me
somewhat:
I
do
not
know;
it
was
at
least
but
a
drop
in
the
sea
to
the
abhorrence
with
which
I
looked
back
upon
these
hours.
A
change
had
come
over
me.
It
was
no
longer
the
fear
of
the
gallows,
it
was
the
horror
of
being
Hyde
that
racked
me.
I
received
Lanyon’s
condemnation
partly
in
a
dream;
it
was
partly
in
a
dream
that
I
came
home
to
my
own
house
and
got
into
bed.
I
slept
after
the
prostration
of
the
day,
with
a
stringent
and
profound
slumber
which
not
even
the
nightmares
that
wrung
me
could
avail
to
break.
I
awoke
in
the
morning
shaken,
weakened,
but
refreshed.
I
still
hated
and
feared
the
thought
of
the
brute
that
slept
within
me,
and
I
had
not
of
course
forgotten
the
appalling
dangers
of
the
day
before;
but
I
was
once
more
at
home,
in
my
own
house
and
close
to
my
drugs;
and
gratitude
for
my
escape
shone
so
strong
in
my
soul
that
it
almost
rivalled
the
brightness
of
hope.
I
was
stepping
leisurely
across
the
court
after

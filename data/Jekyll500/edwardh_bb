alive,
I
shall
consider
it
my
duty
to
break
in
that
door.”
“Ah,
Mr.
Utterson,
that’s
talking!”
cried
the
butler.
“And
now
comes
the
second
question,”
resumed
Utterson:
“Who
is
going
to
do
it?”
“Why,
you
and
me,
sir,”
was
the
undaunted
reply.
“That’s
very
well
said,”
returned
the
lawyer;
“and
whatever
comes
of
it,
I
shall
make
it
my
business
to
see
you
are
no
loser.”
“There
is
an
axe
in
the
theatre,”
continued
Poole;
“and
you
might
take
the
kitchen
poker
for
yourself.”
The
lawyer
took
that
rude
but
weighty
instrument
into
his
hand,
and
balanced
it.
“Do
you
know,
Poole,”
he
said,
looking
up,
“that
you
and
I
are
about
to
place
ourselves
in
a
position
of
some
peril?”
“You
may
say
so,
sir,
indeed,”
returned
the
butler.
“It
is
well,
then
that
we
should
be
frank,”
said
the
other.
“We
both
think
more
than
we
have
said;
let
us
make
a
clean
breast.
This
masked
figure
that
you
saw,
did
you
recognise
it?”
“Well,
sir,
it
went
so
quick,
and
the
creature
was
so
doubled
up,
that
I
could
hardly
swear
to
that,”
was
the
answer.
“But
if
you
mean,
was
it
Mr.
Hyde?--why,
yes,
I
think
it
was!
You
see,
it
was
much
of
the
same
bigness;
and
it
had
the
same
quick,
light
way
with
it;
and
then
who
else
could
have
got
in
by
the
laboratory
door?
You
have
not
forgot,
sir,
that
at
the
time
of
the
murder
he
had
still
the
key
with
him?
But
that’s
not
all.
I
don’t
know,
Mr.
Utterson,
if
you
ever
met
this
Mr.
Hyde?”
“Yes,”
said
the
lawyer,
“I
once
spoke
with
him.”
“Then
you
must
know
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
that
there
was
something
queer
about
that
gentleman--something
that
gave
a
man
a
turn--I
don’t
know
rightly
how
to
say
it,
sir,
beyond
this:
that
you
felt
in
your
marrow
kind
of
cold
and
thin.”
“I
own
I
felt
something
of
what
you
describe,”
said
Mr.
Utterson.
“Quite
so,
sir,”
returned
Poole.
“Well,
when
that
masked
thing
like
a
monkey
jumped
from
among
the
chemicals
and
whipped
into
the
cabinet,
it
went
down
my
spine
like
ice.
O,
I
know
it’s
not
evidence,
Mr.
Utterson;
I’m
book-learned
enough
for
that;
but
a
man
has
his
feelings,
and
I
give
you
my
bible-word
it
was
Mr.
Hyde!”
“Ay,
ay,”
said
the
lawyer.
“My
fears
incline
to
the
same
point.
Evil,
I
fear,
founded--evil
was
sure
to
come--of
that
connection.
Ay
truly,
I
believe
you;
I
believe
poor
Harry
is
killed;
and
I
believe
his
murderer
(for
what
purpose,
God
alone
can
tell)
is
still
lurking
in
his
victim’s
room.
Well,
let
our
name
be
vengeance.
Call
Bradshaw.”
The
footman
came
at
the
summons,
very
white
and
nervous.
“Put
yourself
together,
Bradshaw,”
said
the
lawyer.
“This
suspense,
I
know,
is
telling
upon
all
of
you;
but
it
is
now
our
intention
to
make
an
end
of
it.
Poole,
here,
and
I
are
going

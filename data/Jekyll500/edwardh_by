a
part
instead
of
a
person;
but
he
loathed
the
necessity,
he
loathed
the
despondency
into
which
Jekyll
was
now
fallen,
and
he
resented
the
dislike
with
which
he
was
himself
regarded.
Hence
the
ape-like
tricks
that
he
would
play
me,
scrawling
in
my
own
hand
blasphemies
on
the
pages
of
my
books,
burning
the
letters
and
destroying
the
portrait
of
my
father;
and
indeed,
had
it
not
been
for
his
fear
of
death,
he
would
long
ago
have
ruined
himself
in
order
to
involve
me
in
the
ruin.
But
his
love
of
me
is
wonderful;
I
go
further:
I,
who
sicken
and
freeze
at
the
mere
thought
of
him,
when
I
recall
the
abjection
and
passion
of
this
attachment,
and
when
I
know
how
he
fears
my
power
to
cut
him
off
by
suicide,
I
find
it
in
my
heart
to
pity
him.
It
is
useless,
and
the
time
awfully
fails
me,
to
prolong
this
description;
no
one
has
ever
suffered
such
torments,
let
that
suffice;
and
yet
even
to
these,
habit
brought--no,
not
alleviation--but
a
certain
callousness
of
soul,
a
certain
acquiescence
of
despair;
and
my
punishment
might
have
gone
on
for
years,
but
for
the
last
calamity
which
has
now
fallen,
and
which
has
finally
severed
me
from
my
own
face
and
nature.
My
provision
of
the
salt,
which
had
never
been
renewed
since
the
date
of
the
first
experiment,
began
to
run
low.
I
sent
out
for
a
fresh
supply
and
mixed
the
draught;
the
ebullition
followed,
and
the
first
change
of
colour,
not
the
second;
I
drank
it
and
it
was
without
efficiency.
You
will
learn
from
Poole
how
I
have
had
London
ransacked;
it
was
in
vain;
and
I
am
now
persuaded
that
my
first
supply
was
impure,
and
that
it
was
that
unknown
impurity
which
lent
efficacy
to
the
draught.
About
a
week
has
passed,
and
I
am
now
finishing
this
statement
under
the
influence
of
the
last
of
the
old
powders.
This,
then,
is
the
last
time,
short
of
a
miracle,
that
Henry
Jekyll
can
think
his
own
thoughts
or
see
his
own
face
(now
how
sadly
altered!)
in
the
glass.
Nor
must
I
delay
too
long
to
bring
my
writing
to
an
end;
for
if
my
narrative
has
hitherto
escaped
destruction,
it
has
been
by
a
combination
of
great
prudence
and
great
good
luck.
Should
the
throes
of
change
take
me
in
the
act
of
writing
it,
Hyde
will
tear
it
in
pieces;
but
if
some
time
shall
have
elapsed
after
I
have
laid
it
by,
his
wonderful
selfishness
and
circumscription
to
the
moment
will
probably
save
it
once
again
from
the
action
of
his
ape-like
spite.
And
indeed
the
doom
that
is
closing
on
us
both
has
already
changed
and
crushed
him.
Half
an
hour
from
now,
when
I
shall
again
and
forever
reindue
that
hated
personality,
I
know
how
I
shall
sit
shuddering
and
weeping
in
my
chair,
or
continue,
with
the
most
strained
and
fearstruck
ecstasy
of
listening,

my
dear
Lanyon
and
save
“Your
friend,
“H.J.
“P.S.--I
had
already
sealed
this
up
when
a
fresh
terror
struck
upon
my
soul.
It
is
possible
that
the
post-office
may
fail
me,
and
this
letter
not
come
into
your
hands
until
to-morrow
morning.
In
that
case,
dear
Lanyon,
do
my
errand
when
it
shall
be
most
convenient
for
you
in
the
course
of
the
day;
and
once
more
expect
my
messenger
at
midnight.
It
may
then
already
be
too
late;
and
if
that
night
passes
without
event,
you
will
know
that
you
have
seen
the
last
of
Henry
Jekyll.”
Upon
the
reading
of
this
letter,
I
made
sure
my
colleague
was
insane;
but
till
that
was
proved
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt,
I
felt
bound
to
do
as
he
requested.
The
less
I
understood
of
this
farrago,
the
less
I
was
in
a
position
to
judge
of
its
importance;
and
an
appeal
so
worded
could
not
be
set
aside
without
a
grave
responsibility.
I
rose
accordingly
from
table,
got
into
a
hansom,
and
drove
straight
to
Jekyll’s
house.
The
butler
was
awaiting
my
arrival;
he
had
received
by
the
same
post
as
mine
a
registered
letter
of
instruction,
and
had
sent
at
once
for
a
locksmith
and
a
carpenter.
The
tradesmen
came
while
we
were
yet
speaking;
and
we
moved
in
a
body
to
old
Dr.
Denman’s
surgical
theatre,
from
which
(as
you
are
doubtless
aware)
Jekyll’s
private
cabinet
is
most
conveniently
entered.
The
door
was
very
strong,
the
lock
excellent;
the
carpenter
avowed
he
would
have
great
trouble
and
have
to
do
much
damage,
if
force
were
to
be
used;
and
the
locksmith
was
near
despair.
But
this
last
was
a
handy
fellow,
and
after
two
hour’s
work,
the
door
stood
open.
The
press
marked
E
was
unlocked;
and
I
took
out
the
drawer,
had
it
filled
up
with
straw
and
tied
in
a
sheet,
and
returned
with
it
to
Cavendish
Square.
Here
I
proceeded
to
examine
its
contents.
The
powders
were
neatly
enough
made
up,
but
not
with
the
nicety
of
the
dispensing
chemist;
so
that
it
was
plain
they
were
of
Jekyll’s
private
manufacture:
and
when
I
opened
one
of
the
wrappers
I
found
what
seemed
to
me
a
simple
crystalline
salt
of
a
white
colour.
The
phial,
to
which
I
next
turned
my
attention,
might
have
been
about
half
full
of
a
blood-red
liquor,
which
was
highly
pungent
to
the
sense
of
smell
and
seemed
to
me
to
contain
phosphorus
and
some
volatile
ether.
At
the
other
ingredients
I
could
make
no
guess.
The
book
was
an
ordinary
version
book
and
contained
little
but
a
series
of
dates.
These
covered
a
period
of
many
years,
but
I
observed
that
the
entries
ceased
nearly
a
year
ago
and
quite
abruptly.
Here
and
there
a
brief
remark
was
appended
to
a
date,
usually
no
more
than
a
single
word:
“double”
occurring
perhaps
six
times
in
a
total
of
several
hundred
entries;
and
once
very
early
in
the
list
and

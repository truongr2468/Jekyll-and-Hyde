Utterson
was
sitting
by
his
fireside
one
evening
after
dinner,
when
he
was
surprised
to
receive
a
visit
from
Poole.
“Bless
me,
Poole,
what
brings
you
here?”
he
cried;
and
then
taking
a
second
look
at
him,
“What
ails
you?”
he
added;
“is
the
doctor
ill?”
“Mr.
Utterson,”
said
the
man,
“there
is
something
wrong.”
“Take
a
seat,
and
here
is
a
glass
of
wine
for
you,”
said
the
lawyer.
“Now,
take
your
time,
and
tell
me
plainly
what
you
want.”
“You
know
the
doctor’s
ways,
sir,”
replied
Poole,
“and
how
he
shuts
himself
up.
Well,
he’s
shut
up
again
in
the
cabinet;
and
I
don’t
like
it,
sir--I
wish
I
may
die
if
I
like
it.
Mr.
Utterson,
sir,
I’m
afraid.”
“Now,
my
good
man,”
said
the
lawyer,
“be
explicit.
What
are
you
afraid
of?”
“I’ve
been
afraid
for
about
a
week,”
returned
Poole,
doggedly
disregarding
the
question,
“and
I
can
bear
it
no
more.”
The
man’s
appearance
amply
bore
out
his
words;
his
manner
was
altered
for
the
worse;
and
except
for
the
moment
when
he
had
first
announced
his
terror,
he
had
not
once
looked
the
lawyer
in
the
face.
Even
now,
he
sat
with
the
glass
of
wine
untasted
on
his
knee,
and
his
eyes
directed
to
a
corner
of
the
floor.
“I
can
bear
it
no
more,”
he
repeated.
“Come,”
said
the
lawyer,
“I
see
you
have
some
good
reason,
Poole;
I
see
there
is
something
seriously
amiss.
Try
to
tell
me
what
it
is.”
“I
think
there’s
been
foul
play,”
said
Poole,
hoarsely.
“Foul
play!”
cried
the
lawyer,
a
good
deal
frightened
and
rather
inclined
to
be
irritated
in
consequence.
“What
foul
play!
What
does
the
man
mean?”
“I
daren’t
say,
sir,”
was
the
answer;
“but
will
you
come
along
with
me
and
see
for
yourself?”
Mr.
Utterson’s
only
answer
was
to
rise
and
get
his
hat
and
greatcoat;
but
he
observed
with
wonder
the
greatness
of
the
relief
that
appeared
upon
the
butler’s
face,
and
perhaps
with
no
less,
that
the
wine
was
still
untasted
when
he
set
it
down
to
follow.
It
was
a
wild,
cold,
seasonable
night
of
March,
with
a
pale
moon,
lying
on
her
back
as
though
the
wind
had
tilted
her,
and
flying
wrack
of
the
most
diaphanous
and
lawny
texture.
The
wind
made
talking
difficult,
and
flecked
the
blood
into
the
face.
It
seemed
to
have
swept
the
streets
unusually
bare
of
passengers,
besides;
for
Mr.
Utterson
thought
he
had
never
seen
that
part
of
London
so
deserted.
He
could
have
wished
it
otherwise;
never
in
his
life
had
he
been
conscious
of
so
sharp
a
wish
to
see
and
touch
his
fellow-creatures;
for
struggle
as
he
might,
there
was
borne
in
upon
his
mind
a
crushing
anticipation
of
calamity.
The
square,
when
they
got
there,
was
full
of
wind
and
dust,
and
the
thin
trees
in
the
garden
were
lashing
themselves
along
the
railing.
Poole,
who
had
kept
all
the
way
a
pace
or
two
ahead,

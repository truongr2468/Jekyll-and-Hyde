now
pulled
up
in
the
middle
of
the
pavement,
and
in
spite
of
the
biting
weather,
took
off
his
hat
and
mopped
his
brow
with
a
red
pocket-handkerchief.
But
for
all
the
hurry
of
his
coming,
these
were
not
the
dews
of
exertion
that
he
wiped
away,
but
the
moisture
of
some
strangling
anguish;
for
his
face
was
white
and
his
voice,
when
he
spoke,
harsh
and
broken.
“Well,
sir,”
he
said,
“here
we
are,
and
God
grant
there
be
nothing
wrong.”
“Amen,
Poole,”
said
the
lawyer.
Thereupon
the
servant
knocked
in
a
very
guarded
manner;
the
door
was
opened
on
the
chain;
and
a
voice
asked
from
within,
“Is
that
you,
Poole?”
“It’s
all
right,”
said
Poole.
“Open
the
door.”
The
hall,
when
they
entered
it,
was
brightly
lighted
up;
the
fire
was
built
high;
and
about
the
hearth
the
whole
of
the
servants,
men
and
women,
stood
huddled
together
like
a
flock
of
sheep.
At
the
sight
of
Mr.
Utterson,
the
housemaid
broke
into
hysterical
whimpering;
and
the
cook,
crying
out
“Bless
God!
it’s
Mr.
Utterson,”
ran
forward
as
if
to
take
him
in
her
arms.
“What,
what?
Are
you
all
here?”
said
the
lawyer
peevishly.
“Very
irregular,
very
unseemly;
your
master
would
be
far
from
pleased.”
“They’re
all
afraid,”
said
Poole.
Blank
silence
followed,
no
one
protesting;
only
the
maid
lifted
her
voice
and
now
wept
loudly.
“Hold
your
tongue!”
Poole
said
to
her,
with
a
ferocity
of
accent
that
testified
to
his
own
jangled
nerves;
and
indeed,
when
the
girl
had
so
suddenly
raised
the
note
of
her
lamentation,
they
had
all
started
and
turned
towards
the
inner
door
with
faces
of
dreadful
expectation.
“And
now,”
continued
the
butler,
addressing
the
knife-boy,
“reach
me
a
candle,
and
we’ll
get
this
through
hands
at
once.”
And
then
he
begged
Mr.
Utterson
to
follow
him,
and
led
the
way
to
the
back
garden.
“Now,
sir,”
said
he,
“you
come
as
gently
as
you
can.
I
want
you
to
hear,
and
I
don’t
want
you
to
be
heard.
And
see
here,
sir,
if
by
any
chance
he
was
to
ask
you
in,
don’t
go.”
Mr.
Utterson’s
nerves,
at
this
unlooked-for
termination,
gave
a
jerk
that
nearly
threw
him
from
his
balance;
but
he
recollected
his
courage
and
followed
the
butler
into
the
laboratory
building
through
the
surgical
theatre,
with
its
lumber
of
crates
and
bottles,
to
the
foot
of
the
stair.
Here
Poole
motioned
him
to
stand
on
one
side
and
listen;
while
he
himself,
setting
down
the
candle
and
making
a
great
and
obvious
call
on
his
resolution,
mounted
the
steps
and
knocked
with
a
somewhat
uncertain
hand
on
the
red
baize
of
the
cabinet
door.
“Mr.
Utterson,
sir,
asking
to
see
you,”
he
called;
and
even
as
he
did
so,
once
more
violently
signed
to
the
lawyer
to
give
ear.
A
voice
answered
from
within:
“Tell
him
I
cannot
see
anyone,”
it
said
complainingly.
“Thank
you,
sir,”
said
Poole,
with
a
note
of
something
like
triumph
in

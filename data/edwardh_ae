which
is
generally
smoking;
so
somebody
must
live
there.
And
yet
it’s
not
so
sure;
for
the
buildings
are
so
packed
together
about
the
court,
that
it’s
hard
to
say
where
one
ends
and
another
begins.”
The
pair
walked
on
again
for
a
while
in
silence;
and
then
“Enfield,”
said
Mr.
Utterson,
“that’s
a
good
rule
of
yours.”
“Yes,
I
think
it
is,”
returned
Enfield.
“But
for
all
that,”
continued
the
lawyer,
“there’s
one
point
I
want
to
ask:
I
want
to
ask
the
name
of
that
man
who
walked
over
the
child.”
“Well,”
said
Mr.
Enfield,
“I
can’t
see
what
harm
it
would
do.
It
was
a
man
of
the
name
of
Hyde.”
“Hm,”
said
Mr.
Utterson.
“What
sort
of
a
man
is
he
to
see?”
“He
is
not
easy
to
describe.
There
is
something
wrong
with
his
appearance;
something
displeasing,
something
down-right
detestable.
I
never
saw
a
man
I
so
disliked,
and
yet
I
scarce
know
why.
He
must
be
deformed
somewhere;
he
gives
a
strong
feeling
of
deformity,
although
I
couldn’t
specify
the
point.
He’s
an
extraordinary
looking
man,
and
yet
I
really
can
name
nothing
out
of
the
way.
No,
sir;
I
can
make
no
hand
of
it;
I
can’t
describe
him.
And
it’s
not
want
of
memory;
for
I
declare
I
can
see
him
this
moment.”
Mr.
Utterson
again
walked
some
way
in
silence
and
obviously
under
a
weight
of
consideration.
“You
are
sure
he
used
a
key?”
he
inquired
at
last.
“My
dear
sir...”
began
Enfield,
surprised
out
of
himself.
“Yes,
I
know,”
said
Utterson;
“I
know
it
must
seem
strange.
The
fact
is,
if
I
do
not
ask
you
the
name
of
the
other
party,
it
is
because
I
know
it
already.
You
see,
Richard,
your
tale
has
gone
home.
If
you
have
been
inexact
in
any
point
you
had
better
correct
it.”
“I
think
you
might
have
warned
me,”
returned
the
other
with
a
touch
of
sullenness.
“But
I
have
been
pedantically
exact,
as
you
call
it.
The
fellow
had
a
key;
and
what’s
more,
he
has
it
still.
I
saw
him
use
it
not
a
week
ago.”
Mr.
Utterson
sighed
deeply
but
said
never
a
word;
and
the
young
man
presently
resumed.
“Here
is
another
lesson
to
say
nothing,”
said
he.
“I
am
ashamed
of
my
long
tongue.
Let
us
make
a
bargain
never
to
refer
to
this
again.”
“With
all
my
heart,”
said
the
lawyer.
“I
shake
hands
on
that,
Richard.”
SEARCH
FOR
MR.
HYDE
That
evening
Mr.
Utterson
came
home
to
his
bachelor
house
in
sombre
spirits
and
sat
down
to
dinner
without
relish.
It
was
his
custom
of
a
Sunday,
when
this
meal
was
over,
to
sit
close
by
the
fire,
a
volume
of
some
dry
divinity
on
his
reading
desk,
until
the
clock
of
the
neighbouring
church
rang
out
the
hour
of
twelve,
when
he
would
go
soberly
and
gratefully
to
bed.
On
this
night
however,
as
soon
as
the
cloth
was
taken
away,
he
took
up

and
swift
to
seize
the
occasion;
and
the
thing
that
was
projected
was
Edward
Hyde.
Hence,
although
I
had
now
two
characters
as
well
as
two
appearances,
one
was
wholly
evil,
and
the
other
was
still
the
old
Henry
Jekyll,
that
incongruous
compound
of
whose
reformation
and
improvement
I
had
already
learned
to
despair.
The
movement
was
thus
wholly
toward
the
worse.
Even
at
that
time,
I
had
not
conquered
my
aversions
to
the
dryness
of
a
life
of
study.
I
would
still
be
merrily
disposed
at
times;
and
as
my
pleasures
were
(to
say
the
least)
undignified,
and
I
was
not
only
well
known
and
highly
considered,
but
growing
towards
the
elderly
man,
this
incoherency
of
my
life
was
daily
growing
more
unwelcome.
It
was
on
this
side
that
my
new
power
tempted
me
until
I
fell
in
slavery.
I
had
but
to
drink
the
cup,
to
doff
at
once
the
body
of
the
noted
professor,
and
to
assume,
like
a
thick
cloak,
that
of
Edward
Hyde.
I
smiled
at
the
notion;
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
to
be
humourous;
and
I
made
my
preparations
with
the
most
studious
care.
I
took
and
furnished
that
house
in
Soho,
to
which
Hyde
was
tracked
by
the
police;
and
engaged
as
a
housekeeper
a
creature
whom
I
knew
well
to
be
silent
and
unscrupulous.
On
the
other
side,
I
announced
to
my
servants
that
a
Mr.
Hyde
(whom
I
described)
was
to
have
full
liberty
and
power
about
my
house
in
the
square;
and
to
parry
mishaps,
I
even
called
and
made
myself
a
familiar
object,
in
my
second
character.
I
next
drew
up
that
will
to
which
you
so
much
objected;
so
that
if
anything
befell
me
in
the
person
of
Dr.
Jekyll,
I
could
enter
on
that
of
Edward
Hyde
without
pecuniary
loss.
And
thus
fortified,
as
I
supposed,
on
every
side,
I
began
to
profit
by
the
strange
immunities
of
my
position.
Men
have
before
hired
bravos
to
transact
their
crimes,
while
their
own
person
and
reputation
sat
under
shelter.
I
was
the
first
that
ever
did
so
for
his
pleasures.
I
was
the
first
that
could
plod
in
the
public
eye
with
a
load
of
genial
respectability,
and
in
a
moment,
like
a
schoolboy,
strip
off
these
lendings
and
spring
headlong
into
the
sea
of
liberty.
But
for
me,
in
my
impenetrable
mantle,
the
safety
was
complete.
Think
of
it--I
did
not
even
exist!
Let
me
but
escape
into
my
laboratory
door,
give
me
but
a
second
or
two
to
mix
and
swallow
the
draught
that
I
had
always
standing
ready;
and
whatever
he
had
done,
Edward
Hyde
would
pass
away
like
the
stain
of
breath
upon
a
mirror;
and
there
in
his
stead,
quietly
at
home,
trimming
the
midnight
lamp
in
his
study,
a
man
who
could
afford
to
laugh
at
suspicion,
would
be
Henry
Jekyll.
The
pleasures
which
I
made
haste
to
seek
in
my
disguise
were,
as
I
have
said,
undignified;
I

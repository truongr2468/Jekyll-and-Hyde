in
possession;
he
had
no
cause
to
like
me;
he
must
have
raged
to
see
himself
displaced;
and
he
has
not
destroyed
this
document.”
He
caught
up
the
next
paper;
it
was
a
brief
note
in
the
doctor’s
hand
and
dated
at
the
top.
“O
Poole!”
the
lawyer
cried,
“he
was
alive
and
here
this
day.
He
cannot
have
been
disposed
of
in
so
short
a
space;
he
must
be
still
alive,
he
must
have
fled!
And
then,
why
fled?
and
how?
and
in
that
case,
can
we
venture
to
declare
this
suicide?
O,
we
must
be
careful.
I
foresee
that
we
may
yet
involve
your
master
in
some
dire
catastrophe.”
“Why
don’t
you
read
it,
sir?”
asked
Poole.
“Because
I
fear,”
replied
the
lawyer
solemnly.
“God
grant
I
have
no
cause
for
it!”
And
with
that
he
brought
the
paper
to
his
eyes
and
read
as
follows:
“My
dear
Utterson,--When
this
shall
fall
into
your
hands,
I
shall
have
disappeared,
under
what
circumstances
I
have
not
the
penetration
to
foresee,
but
my
instinct
and
all
the
circumstances
of
my
nameless
situation
tell
me
that
the
end
is
sure
and
must
be
early.
Go
then,
and
first
read
the
narrative
which
Lanyon
warned
me
he
was
to
place
in
your
hands;
and
if
you
care
to
hear
more,
turn
to
the
confession
of
“Your
unworthy
and
unhappy
friend,
“HENRY
JEKYLL.”
“There
was
a
third
enclosure?”
asked
Utterson.
“Here,
sir,”
said
Poole,
and
gave
into
his
hands
a
considerable
packet
sealed
in
several
places.
The
lawyer
put
it
in
his
pocket.
“I
would
say
nothing
of
this
paper.
If
your
master
has
fled
or
is
dead,
we
may
at
least
save
his
credit.
It
is
now
ten;
I
must
go
home
and
read
these
documents
in
quiet;
but
I
shall
be
back
before
midnight,
when
we
shall
send
for
the
police.”
They
went
out,
locking
the
door
of
the
theatre
behind
them;
and
Utterson,
once
more
leaving
the
servants
gathered
about
the
fire
in
the
hall,
trudged
back
to
his
office
to
read
the
two
narratives
in
which
this
mystery
was
now
to
be
explained.
DR.
LANYON’S
NARRATIVE
On
the
ninth
of
January,
now
four
days
ago,
I
received
by
the
evening
delivery
a
registered
envelope,
addressed
in
the
hand
of
my
colleague
and
old
school
companion,
Henry
Jekyll.
I
was
a
good
deal
surprised
by
this;
for
we
were
by
no
means
in
the
habit
of
correspondence;
I
had
seen
the
man,
dined
with
him,
indeed,
the
night
before;
and
I
could
imagine
nothing
in
our
intercourse
that
should
justify
formality
of
registration.
The
contents
increased
my
wonder;
for
this
is
how
the
letter
ran:
“10th
December,
18--.
“Dear
Lanyon,--You
are
one
of
my
oldest
friends;
and
although
we
may
have
differed
at
times
on
scientific
questions,
I
cannot
remember,
at
least
on
my
side,
any
break
in
our
affection.
There
was
never
a
day
when,
if
you
had
said
to
me,
`Jekyll,
my
life,
my
honour,
my
reason,
depend

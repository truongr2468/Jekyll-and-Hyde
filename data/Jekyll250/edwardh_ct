its
heels
to
my
politeness.
I
come
here
at
the
instance
of
your
colleague,
Dr.
Henry
Jekyll,
on
a
piece
of
business
of
some
moment;
and
I
understood...”
He
paused
and
put
his
hand
to
his
throat,
and
I
could
see,
in
spite
of
his
collected
manner,
that
he
was
wrestling
against
the
approaches
of
the
hysteria--“I
understood,
a
drawer...”
But
here
I
took
pity
on
my
visitor’s
suspense,
and
some
perhaps
on
my
own
growing
curiosity.
“There
it
is,
sir,”
said
I,
pointing
to
the
drawer,
where
it
lay
on
the
floor
behind
a
table
and
still
covered
with
the
sheet.
He
sprang
to
it,
and
then
paused,
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart:
I
could
hear
his
teeth
grate
with
the
convulsive
action
of
his
jaws;
and
his
face
was
so
ghastly
to
see
that
I
grew
alarmed
both
for
his
life
and
reason.
“Compose
yourself,”
said
I.
He
turned
a
dreadful
smile
to
me,
and
as
if
with
the
decision
of
despair,
plucked
away
the
sheet.
At
sight
of
the
contents,
he
uttered
one
loud
sob
of
such
immense
relief
that
I
sat
petrified.
And
the
next
moment,
in
a
voice
that
was
already
fairly
well
under
control,
“Have
you
a
graduated
glass?”
he
asked.
I
rose
from
my
place
with
something
of
an
effort
and
gave
him
what
he
asked.
He
thanked
me
with
a
smiling
nod,
measured
out
a
few
minims
of
the
red
tincture
and
added
one
of
the
powders.
The
mixture,

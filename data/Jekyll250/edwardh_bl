“And
by
all
accounts
a
very
odd
writer,”
added
the
lawyer.
Just
then
the
servant
entered
with
a
note.
“Is
that
from
Dr.
Jekyll,
sir?”
inquired
the
clerk.
“I
thought
I
knew
the
writing.
Anything
private,
Mr.
Utterson?”
“Only
an
invitation
to
dinner.
Why?
Do
you
want
to
see
it?”
“One
moment.
I
thank
you,
sir;”
and
the
clerk
laid
the
two
sheets
of
paper
alongside
and
sedulously
compared
their
contents.
“Thank
you,
sir,”
he
said
at
last,
returning
both;
“it’s
a
very
interesting
autograph.”
There
was
a
pause,
during
which
Mr.
Utterson
struggled
with
himself.
“Why
did
you
compare
them,
Guest?”
he
inquired
suddenly.
“Well,
sir,”
returned
the
clerk,
“there’s
a
rather
singular
resemblance;
the
two
hands
are
in
many
points
identical:
only
differently
sloped.”
“Rather
quaint,”
said
Utterson.
“It
is,
as
you
say,
rather
quaint,”
returned
Guest.
“I
wouldn’t
speak
of
this
note,
you
know,”
said
the
master.
“No,
sir,”
said
the
clerk.
“I
understand.”
But
no
sooner
was
Mr.
Utterson
alone
that
night,
than
he
locked
the
note
into
his
safe,
where
it
reposed
from
that
time
forward.
“What!”
he
thought.
“Henry
Jekyll
forge
for
a
murderer!”
And
his
blood
ran
cold
in
his
veins.
INCIDENT
OF
DR.
LANYON
Time
ran
on;
thousands
of
pounds
were
offered
in
reward,
for
the
death
of
Sir
Danvers
was
resented
as
a
public
injury;
but
Mr.
Hyde
had
disappeared
out
of
the
ken
of
the
police
as
though
he
had
never
existed.
Much
of
his
past
was
unearthed,
indeed,
and

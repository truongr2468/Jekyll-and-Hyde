if
out
of
a
great
sickness.
There
was
something
strange
in
my
sensations,
something
indescribably
new
and,
from
its
very
novelty,
incredibly
sweet.
I
felt
younger,
lighter,
happier
in
body;
within
I
was
conscious
of
a
heady
recklessness,
a
current
of
disordered
sensual
images
running
like
a
millrace
in
my
fancy,
a
solution
of
the
bonds
of
obligation,
an
unknown
but
not
an
innocent
freedom
of
the
soul.
I
knew
myself,
at
the
first
breath
of
this
new
life,
to
be
more
wicked,
tenfold
more
wicked,
sold
a
slave
to
my
original
evil;
and
the
thought,
in
that
moment,
braced
and
delighted
me
like
wine.
I
stretched
out
my
hands,
exulting
in
the
freshness
of
these
sensations;
and
in
the
act,
I
was
suddenly
aware
that
I
had
lost
in
stature.
There
was
no
mirror,
at
that
date,
in
my
room;
that
which
stands
beside
me
as
I
write,
was
brought
there
later
on
and
for
the
very
purpose
of
these
transformations.
The
night
however,
was
far
gone
into
the
morning--the
morning,
black
as
it
was,
was
nearly
ripe
for
the
conception
of
the
day--the
inmates
of
my
house
were
locked
in
the
most
rigorous
hours
of
slumber;
and
I
determined,
flushed
as
I
was
with
hope
and
triumph,
to
venture
in
my
new
shape
as
far
as
to
my
bedroom.
I
crossed
the
yard,
wherein
the
constellations
looked
down
upon
me,
I
could
have
thought,
with
wonder,
the
first
creature
of
that
sort

unsleeping
vigilance

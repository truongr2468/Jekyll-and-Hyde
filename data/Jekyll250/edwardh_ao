the
more
swiftly,
even
to
dizziness,
through
wider
labyrinths
of
lamplighted
city,
and
at
every
street
corner
crush
a
child
and
leave
her
screaming.
And
still
the
figure
had
no
face
by
which
he
might
know
it;
even
in
his
dreams,
it
had
no
face,
or
one
that
baffled
him
and
melted
before
his
eyes;
and
thus
it
was
that
there
sprang
up
and
grew
apace
in
the
lawyer’s
mind
a
singularly
strong,
almost
an
inordinate,
curiosity
to
behold
the
features
of
the
real
Mr.
Hyde.
If
he
could
but
once
set
eyes
on
him,
he
thought
the
mystery
would
lighten
and
perhaps
roll
altogether
away,
as
was
the
habit
of
mysterious
things
when
well
examined.
He
might
see
a
reason
for
his
friend’s
strange
preference
or
bondage
(call
it
which
you
please)
and
even
for
the
startling
clause
of
the
will.
At
least
it
would
be
a
face
worth
seeing:
the
face
of
a
man
who
was
without
bowels
of
mercy:
a
face
which
had
but
to
show
itself
to
raise
up,
in
the
mind
of
the
unimpressionable
Enfield,
a
spirit
of
enduring
hatred.
From
that
time
forward,
Mr.
Utterson
began
to
haunt
the
door
in
the
by-street
of
shops.
In
the
morning
before
office
hours,
at
noon
when
business
was
plenty,
and
time
scarce,
at
night
under
the
face
of
the
fogged
city
moon,
by
all
lights
and
at
all
hours
of
solitude
or
concourse,
the
lawyer
was
to
be
found
on
his
chosen
post.

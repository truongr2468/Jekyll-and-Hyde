and
the
next
day
brought
him
a
long
answer,
often
very
pathetically
worded,
and
sometimes
darkly
mysterious
in
drift.
The
quarrel
with
Lanyon
was
incurable.
“I
do
not
blame
our
old
friend,”
Jekyll
wrote,
“but
I
share
his
view
that
we
must
never
meet.
I
mean
from
henceforth
to
lead
a
life
of
extreme
seclusion;
you
must
not
be
surprised,
nor
must
you
doubt
my
friendship,
if
my
door
is
often
shut
even
to
you.
You
must
suffer
me
to
go
my
own
dark
way.
I
have
brought
on
myself
a
punishment
and
a
danger
that
I
cannot
name.
If
I
am
the
chief
of
sinners,
I
am
the
chief
of
sufferers
also.
I
could
not
think
that
this
earth
contained
a
place
for
sufferings
and
terrors
so
unmanning;
and
you
can
do
but
one
thing,
Utterson,
to
lighten
this
destiny,
and
that
is
to
respect
my
silence.”
Utterson
was
amazed;
the
dark
influence
of
Hyde
had
been
withdrawn,
the
doctor
had
returned
to
his
old
tasks
and
amities;
a
week
ago,
the
prospect
had
smiled
with
every
promise
of
a
cheerful
and
an
honoured
age;
and
now
in
a
moment,
friendship,
and
peace
of
mind,
and
the
whole
tenor
of
his
life
were
wrecked.
So
great
and
unprepared
a
change
pointed
to
madness;
but
in
view
of
Lanyon’s
manner
and
words,
there
must
lie
for
it
some
deeper
ground.
A
week
afterwards
Dr.
Lanyon
took
to
his
bed,
and
in
something
less
than
a
fortnight
he
was
dead.

from
the
aspirations
and
remorse
of
his
more
upright
twin;
and
the
just
could
walk
steadfastly
and
securely
on
his
upward
path,
doing
the
good
things
in
which
he
found
his
pleasure,
and
no
longer
exposed
to
disgrace
and
penitence
by
the
hands
of
this
extraneous
evil.
It
was
the
curse
of
mankind
that
these
incongruous
faggots
were
thus
bound
together--that
in
the
agonised
womb
of
consciousness,
these
polar
twins
should
be
continuously
struggling.
How,
then
were
they
dissociated?
I
was
so
far
in
my
reflections
when,
as
I
have
said,
a
side
light
began
to
shine
upon
the
subject
from
the
laboratory
table.
I
began
to
perceive
more
deeply
than
it
has
ever
yet
been
stated,
the
trembling
immateriality,
the
mistlike
transience,
of
this
seemingly
so
solid
body
in
which
we
walk
attired.
Certain
agents
I
found
to
have
the
power
to
shake
and
pluck
back
that
fleshly
vestment,
even
as
a
wind
might
toss
the
curtains
of
a
pavilion.
For
two
good
reasons,
I
will
not
enter
deeply
into
this
scientific
branch
of
my
confession.
First,
because
I
have
been
made
to
learn
that
the
doom
and
burthen
of
our
life
is
bound
for
ever
on
manâ€™s
shoulders,
and
when
the
attempt
is
made
to
cast
it
off,
it
but
returns
upon
us
with
more
unfamiliar
and
more
awful
pressure.
Second,
because,
as
my
narrative
will
make,
alas!
too
evident,
my
discoveries
were
incomplete.
Enough
then,
that
I
not
only
recognised
my
natural
body
from
the
mere
aura

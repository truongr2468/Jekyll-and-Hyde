more
of
Mr.
Hyde.”
“I
hope
not,”
said
Utterson.
“Did
I
ever
tell
you
that
I
once
saw
him,
and
shared
your
feeling
of
repulsion?”
“It
was
impossible
to
do
the
one
without
the
other,”
returned
Enfield.
“And
by
the
way,
what
an
ass
you
must
have
thought
me,
not
to
know
that
this
was
a
back
way
to
Dr.
Jekyll’s!
It
was
partly
your
own
fault
that
I
found
it
out,
even
when
I
did.”
“So
you
found
it
out,
did
you?”
said
Utterson.
“But
if
that
be
so,
we
may
step
into
the
court
and
take
a
look
at
the
windows.
To
tell
you
the
truth,
I
am
uneasy
about
poor
Jekyll;
and
even
outside,
I
feel
as
if
the
presence
of
a
friend
might
do
him
good.”
The
court
was
very
cool
and
a
little
damp,
and
full
of
premature
twilight,
although
the
sky,
high
up
overhead,
was
still
bright
with
sunset.
The
middle
one
of
the
three
windows
was
half-way
open;
and
sitting
close
beside
it,
taking
the
air
with
an
infinite
sadness
of
mien,
like
some
disconsolate
prisoner,
Utterson
saw
Dr.
Jekyll.
“What!
Jekyll!”
he
cried.
“I
trust
you
are
better.”
“I
am
very
low,
Utterson,”
replied
the
doctor
drearily,
“very
low.
It
will
not
last
long,
thank
God.”
“You
stay
too
much
indoors,”
said
the
lawyer.
“You
should
be
out,
whipping
up
the
circulation
like
Mr.
Enfield
and
me.
(This
is
my
cousin--Mr.
Enfield--Dr.
Jekyll.)
Come
now;
get
your
hat
and
take

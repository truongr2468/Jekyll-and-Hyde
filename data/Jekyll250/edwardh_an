of
little
ease
to
his
toiling
mind,
toiling
in
mere
darkness
and
beseiged
by
questions.
Six
o’clock
struck
on
the
bells
of
the
church
that
was
so
conveniently
near
to
Mr.
Utterson’s
dwelling,
and
still
he
was
digging
at
the
problem.
Hitherto
it
had
touched
him
on
the
intellectual
side
alone;
but
now
his
imagination
also
was
engaged,
or
rather
enslaved;
and
as
he
lay
and
tossed
in
the
gross
darkness
of
the
night
and
the
curtained
room,
Mr.
Enfield’s
tale
went
by
before
his
mind
in
a
scroll
of
lighted
pictures.
He
would
be
aware
of
the
great
field
of
lamps
of
a
nocturnal
city;
then
of
the
figure
of
a
man
walking
swiftly;
then
of
a
child
running
from
the
doctor’s;
and
then
these
met,
and
that
human
Juggernaut
trod
the
child
down
and
passed
on
regardless
of
her
screams.
Or
else
he
would
see
a
room
in
a
rich
house,
where
his
friend
lay
asleep,
dreaming
and
smiling
at
his
dreams;
and
then
the
door
of
that
room
would
be
opened,
the
curtains
of
the
bed
plucked
apart,
the
sleeper
recalled,
and
lo!
there
would
stand
by
his
side
a
figure
to
whom
power
was
given,
and
even
at
that
dead
hour,
he
must
rise
and
do
its
bidding.
The
figure
in
these
two
phases
haunted
the
lawyer
all
night;
and
if
at
any
time
he
dozed
over,
it
was
but
to
see
it
glide
more
stealthily
through
sleeping
houses,
or
move
the
more
swiftly
and
still

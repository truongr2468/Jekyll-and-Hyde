in
possession;
he
had
no
cause
to
like
me;
he
must
have
raged
to
see
himself
displaced;
and
he
has
not
destroyed
this
document.”
He
caught
up
the
next
paper;
it
was
a
brief
note
in
the
doctor’s
hand
and
dated
at
the
top.
“O
Poole!”
the
lawyer
cried,
“he
was
alive
and
here
this
day.
He
cannot
have
been
disposed
of
in
so
short
a
space;
he
must
be
still
alive,
he
must
have
fled!
And
then,
why
fled?
and
how?
and
in
that
case,
can
we
venture
to
declare
this
suicide?
O,
we
must
be
careful.
I
foresee
that
we
may
yet
involve
your
master
in
some
dire
catastrophe.”
“Why
don’t
you
read
it,
sir?”
asked
Poole.
“Because
I
fear,”
replied
the
lawyer
solemnly.
“God
grant
I
have
no
cause
for
it!”
And
with
that
he
brought
the
paper
to
his
eyes
and
read
as
follows:
“My
dear
Utterson,--When
this
shall
fall
into
your
hands,
I
shall
have
disappeared,
under
what
circumstances
I
have
not
the
penetration
to
foresee,
but
my
instinct
and
all
the
circumstances
of
my
nameless
situation
tell
me
that
the
end
is
sure
and
must
be
early.
Go
then,
and
first
read
the
narrative
which
Lanyon
warned
me
he
was
to
place
in
your
hands;
and
if
you
care
to
hear
more,
turn
to
the
confession
of
“Your
unworthy
and
unhappy
friend,
“HENRY
JEKYLL.”
“There
was
a
third
enclosure?”
asked
Utterson.
“Here,
sir,”
said
Poole,
and
gave
into
his
hands
a
considerable
packet
sealed

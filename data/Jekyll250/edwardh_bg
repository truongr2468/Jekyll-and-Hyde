through
this,
Mr.
Utterson
was
at
last
received
into
the
doctor’s
cabinet.
It
was
a
large
room
fitted
round
with
glass
presses,
furnished,
among
other
things,
with
a
cheval-glass
and
a
business
table,
and
looking
out
upon
the
court
by
three
dusty
windows
barred
with
iron.
The
fire
burned
in
the
grate;
a
lamp
was
set
lighted
on
the
chimney
shelf,
for
even
in
the
houses
the
fog
began
to
lie
thickly;
and
there,
close
up
to
the
warmth,
sat
Dr.
Jekyll,
looking
deathly
sick.
He
did
not
rise
to
meet
his
visitor,
but
held
out
a
cold
hand
and
bade
him
welcome
in
a
changed
voice.
“And
now,”
said
Mr.
Utterson,
as
soon
as
Poole
had
left
them,
“you
have
heard
the
news?”
The
doctor
shuddered.
“They
were
crying
it
in
the
square,”
he
said.
“I
heard
them
in
my
dining-room.”
“One
word,”
said
the
lawyer.
“Carew
was
my
client,
but
so
are
you,
and
I
want
to
know
what
I
am
doing.
You
have
not
been
mad
enough
to
hide
this
fellow?”
“Utterson,
I
swear
to
God,”
cried
the
doctor,
“I
swear
to
God
I
will
never
set
eyes
on
him
again.
I
bind
my
honour
to
you
that
I
am
done
with
him
in
this
world.
It
is
all
at
an
end.
And
indeed
he
does
not
want
my
help;
you
do
not
know
him
as
I
do;
he
is
safe,
he
is
quite
safe;
mark
my
words,
he
will
never
more
be
heard
of.”

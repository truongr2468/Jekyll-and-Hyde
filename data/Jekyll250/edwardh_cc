alive,
I
shall
consider
it
my
duty
to
break
in
that
door.”
“Ah,
Mr.
Utterson,
that’s
talking!”
cried
the
butler.
“And
now
comes
the
second
question,”
resumed
Utterson:
“Who
is
going
to
do
it?”
“Why,
you
and
me,
sir,”
was
the
undaunted
reply.
“That’s
very
well
said,”
returned
the
lawyer;
“and
whatever
comes
of
it,
I
shall
make
it
my
business
to
see
you
are
no
loser.”
“There
is
an
axe
in
the
theatre,”
continued
Poole;
“and
you
might
take
the
kitchen
poker
for
yourself.”
The
lawyer
took
that
rude
but
weighty
instrument
into
his
hand,
and

so,

the

“It
is
well,
then
that
we
should
be
frank,”
said
the
other.
“We
both
think
more
than
we
have
said;
let
us
make
a
clean
breast.
This
masked
figure
that
you
saw,
did
you
recognise
it?”
“Well,
sir,
it
went
so
quick,
and
the
creature
was
so
doubled
up,
that
I
could
hardly
swear
to
that,”
was
the
answer.
“But
if
you
mean,
was
it
Mr.
Hyde?--why,
yes,
I
think
it
was!
You
see,
it
was
much
of
the
same
bigness;
and
it
had
the
same
quick,
light
way
with
it;
and
then
who
else
could
have
got
in
by
the
laboratory
door?
You
have
not

sir,

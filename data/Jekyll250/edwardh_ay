to
understand.
I
have
really
a
very
great
interest
in
poor
Hyde.
I
know
you
have
seen
him;
he
told
me
so;
and
I
fear
he
was
rude.
But
I
do
sincerely
take
a
great,
a
very
great
interest
in
that
young
man;
and
if
I
am
taken
away,
Utterson,
I
wish
you
to
promise
me
that
you
will
bear
with
him
and
get
his
rights
for
him.
I
think
you
would,
if
you
knew
all;
and
it
would
be
a
weight
off
my
mind
if
you
would
promise.”
“I
can’t
pretend
that
I
shall
ever
like
him,”
said
the
lawyer.
“I
don’t
ask
that,”
pleaded
Jekyll,
laying
his
hand
upon
the
other’s
arm;
“I
only
ask
for
justice;
I
only
ask
you
to
help
him
for
my
sake,
when
I
am
no
longer
here.”
Utterson
heaved
an
irrepressible
sigh.
“Well,”
said
he,
“I
promise.”
THE
CAREW
MURDER
CASE
Nearly
a
year
later,
in
the
month
of
October,
18--,
London
was
startled
by
a
crime
of
singular
ferocity
and
rendered
all
the
more
notable
by
the
high
position
of
the
victim.
The
details
were
few
and
startling.
A
maid
servant
living
alone
in
a
house
not
far
from
the
river,
had
gone
upstairs
to
bed
about
eleven.
Although
a
fog
rolled
over
the
city
in
the
small
hours,
the
early
part
of
the
night
was
cloudless,
and
the
lane,
which
the
maid’s
window
overlooked,
was
brilliantly
lit
by
the
full
moon.
It
seems
she
was
romantically
given,
for
she
sat

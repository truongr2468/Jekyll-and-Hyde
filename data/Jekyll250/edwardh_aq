and
the
look
of
him,
even
at
that
distance,
went
somehow
strongly
against
the
watcher’s
inclination.
But
he
made
straight
for
the
door,
crossing
the
roadway
to
save
time;
and
as
he
came,
he
drew
a
key
from
his
pocket
like
one
approaching
home.
Mr.
Utterson
stepped
out
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
as
he
passed.
“Mr.
Hyde,
I
think?”
Mr.
Hyde
shrank
back
with
a
hissing
intake
of
the
breath.
But
his
fear
was
only
momentary;
and
though
he
did
not
look
the
lawyer
in
the
face,
he
answered
coolly
enough:
“That
is
my
name.
What
do
you
want?”
“I
see
you
are
going
in,”
returned
the
lawyer.
“I
am
an
old
friend
of
Dr.
Jekyll’s--Mr.
Utterson
of
Gaunt
Street--you
must
have
heard
of
my
name;
and
meeting
you
so
conveniently,
I
thought
you
might
admit
me.”
“You
will
not
find
Dr.
Jekyll;
he
is
from
home,”
replied
Mr.
Hyde,
blowing
in
the
key.
And
then
suddenly,
but
still
without
looking
up,
“How
did
you
know
me?”
he
asked.
“On
your
side,”
said
Mr.
Utterson
“will
you
do
me
a
favour?”
“With
pleasure,”
replied
the
other.
“What
shall
it
be?”
“Will
you
let
me
see
your
face?”
asked
the
lawyer.
Mr.
Hyde
appeared
to
hesitate,
and
then,
as
if
upon
some
sudden
reflection,
fronted
about
with
an
air
of
defiance;
and
the
pair
stared
at
each
other
pretty
fixedly
for
a
few
seconds.
“Now
I
shall
know
you
again,”
said
Mr.
Utterson.
“It
may
be
useful.”
“Yes,”
returned

listened
gloomily;
he
did
not
like
his
friend’s
feverish
manner.
“You
seem
pretty
sure
of
him,”
said
he;
“and
for
your
sake,
I
hope
you
may
be
right.
If
it
came
to
a
trial,
your
name
might
appear.”
“I
am
quite
sure
of
him,”
replied
Jekyll;
“I
have
grounds
for
certainty
that
I
cannot
share
with
any
one.
But
there
is
one
thing
on
which
you
may
advise
me.
I
have--I
have
received
a
letter;
and
I
am
at
a
loss
whether
I
should
show
it
to
the
police.
I
should
like
to
leave
it
in
your
hands,
Utterson;
you
would
judge
wisely,
I
am
sure;
I
have
so
great
a
trust
in
you.”
“You
fear,
I
suppose,
that
it
might
lead
to
his
detection?”
asked
the
lawyer.
“No,”
said
the
other.
“I
cannot
say
that
I
care
what
becomes
of
Hyde;
I
am
quite
done
with
him.
I
was
thinking
of
my
own
character,
which
this
hateful
business
has
rather
exposed.”
Utterson
ruminated
awhile;
he
was
surprised
at
his
friend’s
selfishness,
and
yet
relieved
by
it.
“Well,”
said
he,
at
last,
“let
me
see
the
letter.”
The
letter
was
written
in
an
odd,
upright
hand
and
signed
“Edward
Hyde”:
and
it
signified,
briefly
enough,
that
the
writer’s
benefactor,
Dr.
Jekyll,
whom
he
had
long
so
unworthily
repaid
for
a
thousand
generosities,
need
labour
under
no
alarm
for
his
safety,
as
he
had
means
of
escape
on
which
he
placed
a
sure
dependence.
The
lawyer
liked
this
letter
well
enough;

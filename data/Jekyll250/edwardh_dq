and
the
Regent’s
Park
was
full
of
winter
chirrupings
and
sweet
with
spring
odours.
I
sat
in
the
sun
on
a
bench;
the
animal
within
me
licking
the
chops
of
memory;
the
spiritual
side
a
little
drowsed,
promising
subsequent
penitence,
but
not
yet
moved
to
begin.
After
all,
I
reflected,
I
was
like
my
neighbours;
and
then
I
smiled,
comparing
myself
with
other
men,
comparing
my
active
good-will
with
the
lazy
cruelty
of
their
neglect.
And
at
the
very
moment
of
that
vainglorious
thought,
a
qualm
came
over
me,
a
horrid
nausea
and
the
most
deadly
shuddering.
These
passed
away,
and
left
me
faint;
and
then
as
in
its
turn
faintness
subsided,
I
began
to
be
aware
of
a
change
in
the
temper
of
my
thoughts,
a
greater
boldness,
a
contempt
of
danger,
a
solution
of
the
bonds
of
obligation.
I
looked
down;
my
clothes
hung
formlessly
on
my
shrunken
limbs;
the
hand
that
lay
on
my
knee
was
corded
and
hairy.
I
was
once
more
Edward
Hyde.
A
moment
before
I
had
been
safe
of
all
men’s
respect,
wealthy,
beloved--the
cloth
laying
for
me
in
the
dining-room
at
home;
and
now
I
was
the
common
quarry
of
mankind,
hunted,
houseless,
a
known
murderer,
thrall
to
the
gallows.
My
reason
wavered,
but
it
did
not
fail
me
utterly.
I
have
more
than
once
observed
that
in
my
second
character,
my
faculties
seemed
sharpened
to
a
point
and
my
spirits
more
tensely
elastic;
thus
it
came
about
that,

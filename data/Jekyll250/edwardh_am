must
be
the
two
oldest
friends
that
Henry
Jekyll
has?”
“I
wish
the
friends
were
younger,”
chuckled
Dr.
Lanyon.
“But
I
suppose
we
are.
And
what
of
that?
I
see
little
of
him
now.”
“Indeed?”
said
Utterson.
“I
thought
you
had
a
bond
of
common
interest.”
“We
had,”
was
the
reply.
“But
it
is
more
than
ten
years
since
Henry
Jekyll
became
too
fanciful
for
me.
He
began
to
go
wrong,
wrong
in
mind;
and
though
of
course
I
continue
to
take
an
interest
in
him
for
old
sake’s
sake,
as
they
say,
I
see
and
I
have
seen
devilish
little
of
the
man.
Such
unscientific
balderdash,”
added
the
doctor,
flushing
suddenly
purple,
“would
have
estranged
Damon
and
Pythias.”
This
little
spirit
of
temper
was
somewhat
of
a
relief
to
Mr.
Utterson.
“They
have
only
differed
on
some
point
of
science,”
he
thought;
and
being
a
man
of
no
scientific
passions
(except
in
the
matter
of
conveyancing),
he
even
added:
“It
is
nothing
worse
than
that!”
He
gave
his
friend
a
few
seconds
to
recover
his
composure,
and
then
approached
the
question
he
had
come
to
put.
“Did
you
ever
come
across
a
protege
of
his--one
Hyde?”
he
asked.
“Hyde?”
repeated
Lanyon.
“No.
Never
heard
of
him.
Since
my
time.”
That
was
the
amount
of
information
that
the
lawyer
carried
back
with
him
to
the
great,
dark
bed
on
which
he
tossed
to
and
fro,
until
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
began
to
grow
large.
It
was
a
night

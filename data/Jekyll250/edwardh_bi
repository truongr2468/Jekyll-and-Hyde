it
put
a
better
colour
on
the
intimacy
than
he
had
looked
for;
and
he
blamed
himself
for
some
of
his
past
suspicions.
“Have
you
the
envelope?”
he
asked.
“I
burned
it,”
replied
Jekyll,
“before
I
thought
what
I
was
about.
But
it
bore
no
postmark.
The
note
was
handed
in.”
“Shall
I
keep
this
and
sleep
upon
it?”
asked
Utterson.
“I
wish
you
to
judge
for
me
entirely,”
was
the
reply.
“I
have
lost
confidence
in
myself.”
“Well,
I
shall
consider,”
returned
the
lawyer.
“And
now
one
word
more:
it
was
Hyde
who
dictated
the
terms
in
your
will
about
that
disappearance?”
The
doctor
seemed
seized
with
a
qualm
of
faintness;
he
shut
his
mouth
tight
and
nodded.
“I
knew
it,”
said
Utterson.
“He
meant
to
murder
you.
You
had
a
fine
escape.”
“I
have
had
what
is
far
more
to
the
purpose,”
returned
the
doctor
solemnly:
“I
have
had
a
lesson--O
God,
Utterson,
what
a
lesson
I
have
had!”
And
he
covered
his
face
for
a
moment
with
his
hands.
On
his
way
out,
the
lawyer
stopped
and
had
a
word
or
two
with
Poole.
“By
the
bye,”
said
he,
“there
was
a
letter
handed
in
to-day:
what
was
the
messenger
like?”
But
Poole
was
positive
nothing
had
come
except
by
post;
“and
only
circulars
by
that,”
he
added.
This
news
sent
off
the
visitor
with
his
fears
renewed.
Plainly
the
letter
had
come
by
the
laboratory
door;
possibly,
indeed,
it
had
been
written
in
the
cabinet;
and

my
professional
life,
to
arrive
again
and
again,
with
the
same
sense
of
unreality,
at
the
damned
horrors
of
the
evening.
I
could
have
screamed
aloud;
I
sought
with
tears
and
prayers
to
smother
down
the
crowd
of
hideous
images
and
sounds
with
which
my
memory
swarmed
against
me;
and
still,
between
the
petitions,
the
ugly
face
of
my
iniquity
stared
into
my
soul.
As
the
acuteness
of
this
remorse
began
to
die
away,
it
was
succeeded
by
a
sense
of
joy.
The
problem
of
my
conduct
was
solved.
Hyde
was
thenceforth
impossible;
whether
I
would
or
not,
I
was
now
confined
to
the
better
part
of
my
existence;
and
O,
how
I
rejoiced
to
think
of
it!
with
what
willing
humility
I
embraced
anew
the
restrictions
of
natural
life!
with
what
sincere
renunciation
I
locked
the
door
by
which
I
had
so
often
gone
and
come,
and
ground
the
key
under
my
heel!
The
next
day,
came
the
news
that
the
murder
had
not
been
overlooked,
that
the
guilt
of
Hyde
was
patent
to
the
world,
and
that
the
victim
was
a
man
high
in
public
estimation.
It
was
not
only
a
crime,
it
had
been
a
tragic
folly.
I
think
I
was
glad
to
know
it;
I
think
I
was
glad
to
have
my
better
impulses
thus
buttressed
and
guarded
by
the
terrors
of
the
scaffold.
Jekyll
was
now
my
city
of
refuge;
let
but
Hyde
peep
out
an
instant,
and
the
hands
of
all
men
would
be

pointed.
“Did
you
ever
remark
that
door?”
he
asked;
and
when
his
companion
had
replied
in
the
affirmative.
“It
is
connected
in
my
mind,”
added
he,
“with
a
very
odd
story.”
“Indeed?”
said
Mr.
Utterson,
with
a
slight
change
of
voice,
“and
what
was
that?”
“Well,
it
was
this
way,”
returned
Mr.
Enfield:
“I
was
coming
home
from
some
place
at
the
end
of
the
world,
about
three
o’clock
of
a
black
winter
morning,
and
my
way
lay
through
a
part
of
town
where
there
was
literally
nothing
to
be
seen
but
lamps.
Street
after
street
and
all
the
folks
asleep--street
after
street,
all
lighted
up
as
if
for
a
procession
and
all

a
church--till
at
last
I
got
into
that
state
of
mind
when
a
man
listens
and
listens
and
begins
to
long
for
the
sight
of
a
policeman.
All
at
once,
I
saw
two
figures:
one
a
little
man
who
was
stumping
along
eastward
at
a
good
walk,
and
the
other
a
girl
of
maybe
eight
or
ten
who
was
running
as
hard
as
she
was
able
down
a
cross
street.
Well,
sir,
the
two
ran
into
one
another
naturally
enough
at
the
corner;
and
then
came
the
horrible
part
of
the
thing;
for
the
man
trampled
calmly
over
the
child’s
body
and
left
her
screaming
on
the
ground.
It
sounds
nothing
to
hear,
but
it
was
hellish
to
see.
It
wasn’t
like
a
man;
it
was
like
some
damned
Juggernaut.

raised
to
take
and
slay
him.
I
resolved
in
my
future
conduct
to
redeem
the
past;
and
I
can
say
with
honesty
that
my
resolve
was
fruitful
of
some
good.
You
know
yourself
how
earnestly,
in
the
last
months
of
the
last
year,
I
laboured
to
relieve
suffering;
you
know
that
much
was
done
for
others,
and
that
the
days
passed
quietly,
almost
happily
for
myself.
Nor
can
I
truly
say
that
I
wearied
of
this
beneficent
and
innocent
life;
I
think
instead
that
I
daily
enjoyed
it
more
completely;
but
I
was
still
cursed
with
my
duality
of
purpose;
and
as
the
first
edge
of
my
penitence
wore
off,
the
lower
side
of
me,
so
long
indulged,
so
recently
chained
down,
began
to
growl
for
licence.
Not
that
I
dreamed
of
resuscitating
Hyde;
the
bare
idea
of
that
would
startle
me
to
frenzy:
no,
it
was
in
my
own
person
that
I
was
once
more
tempted
to
trifle
with
my
conscience;
and
it
was
as
an
ordinary
secret
sinner
that
I
at
last
fell
before
the
assaults
of
temptation.
There
comes
an
end
to
all
things;
the
most
capacious
measure
is
filled
at
last;
and
this
brief
condescension
to
my
evil
finally
destroyed
the
balance
of
my
soul.
And
yet
I
was
not
alarmed;
the
fall
seemed
natural,
like
a
return
to
the
old
days
before
I
had
made
my
discovery.
It
was
a
fine,
clear,
January
day,
wet
under
foot
where
the
frost
had
melted,
but
cloudless
overhead;

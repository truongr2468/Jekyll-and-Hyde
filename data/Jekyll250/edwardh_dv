a
fancy
brimming
with
images
of
terror,
a
soul
boiling
with
causeless
hatreds,
and
a
body
that
seemed
not
strong
enough
to
contain
the
raging
energies
of
life.
The
powers
of
Hyde
seemed
to
have
grown
with
the
sickliness
of
Jekyll.
And
certainly
the
hate
that
now
divided
them
was
equal
on
each
side.
With
Jekyll,
it
was
a
thing
of
vital
instinct.
He
had
now
seen
the
full
deformity
of
that
creature
that
shared
with
him
some
of
the
phenomena
of
consciousness,
and
was
co-heir
with
him
to
death:
and
beyond
these
links
of
community,
which
in
themselves
made
the
most
poignant
part
of
his
distress,
he
thought
of
Hyde,
for
all
his
energy
of
life,
as
of
something
not
only
hellish
but
inorganic.
This
was
the
shocking
thing;
that
the
slime
of
the
pit
seemed
to
utter
cries
and
voices;
that
the
amorphous
dust
gesticulated
and
sinned;
that
what
was
dead,
and
had
no
shape,
should
usurp
the
offices
of
life.
And
this
again,
that
that
insurgent
horror
was
knit
to
him
closer
than
a
wife,
closer
than
an
eye;
lay
caged
in
his
flesh,
where
he
heard
it
mutter
and
felt
it
struggle
to
be
born;
and
at
every
hour
of
weakness,
and
in
the
confidence
of
slumber,
prevailed
against
him,
and
deposed
him
out
of
life.
The
hatred
of
Hyde
for
Jekyll
was
of
a
different
order.
His
terror
of
the
gallows
drove
him
continually
to
commit
temporary
suicide,
and
return
to
his
subordinate
station
of

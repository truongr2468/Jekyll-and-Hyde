before
the
public.
Hence
it
came
about
that
I
concealed
my
pleasures;
and
that
when
I
reached
years
of
reflection,
and
began
to
look
round
me
and
take
stock
of
my
progress
and
position
in
the
world,
I
stood
already
committed
to
a
profound
duplicity
of
life.
Many
a
man
would
have
even
blazoned
such
irregularities
as
I
was
guilty
of;
but
from
the
high
views
that
I
had
set
before
me,
I
regarded
and
hid
them
with
an
almost
morbid
sense
of
shame.
It
was
thus
rather
the
exacting
nature
of
my
aspirations
than
any
particular
degradation
in
my
faults,
that
made
me
what
I
was,
and,
with
even
a
deeper
trench
than
in
the
majority
of
men,
severed
in
me
those
provinces
of
good
and
ill
which
divide
and
compound
manâ€™s
dual
nature.
In
this
case,
I
was
driven
to
reflect
deeply
and
inveterately
on
that
hard
law
of
life,
which
lies
at
the
root
of
religion
and
is
one
of
the
most
plentiful
springs
of
distress.
Though
so
profound
a
double-dealer,
I
was
in
no
sense
a
hypocrite;
both
sides
of
me
were
in
dead
earnest;
I
was
no
more
myself
when
I
laid
aside
restraint
and
plunged
in
shame,
than
when
I
laboured,
in
the
eye
of
day,
at
the
furtherance
of
knowledge
or
the
relief
of
sorrow
and
suffering.
And
it
chanced
that
the
direction
of
my
scientific
studies,
which
led
wholly
towards
the
mystic
and
the
transcendental,
reacted
and
shed
a
strong
light
on

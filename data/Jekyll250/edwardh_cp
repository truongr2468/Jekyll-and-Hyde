the
carpenter
avowed
he
would
have
great
trouble
and
have
to
do
much
damage,
if
force
were
to
be
used;
and
the
locksmith
was
near
despair.
But
this
last
was
a
handy
fellow,
and
after
two
hour’s
work,
the
door
stood
open.
The
press
marked
E
was
unlocked;
and
I
took
out
the
drawer,
had
it
filled
up
with
straw
and
tied
in
a
sheet,
and
returned
with
it
to
Cavendish
Square.
Here
I
proceeded
to
examine
its
contents.
The
powders
were
neatly
enough
made
up,
but
not
with
the
nicety
of
the
dispensing
chemist;
so
that
it
was
plain
they
were
of
Jekyll’s
private
manufacture:
and
when
I
opened
one
of
the
wrappers
I
found
what
seemed
to
me
a
simple
crystalline
salt
of
a
white
colour.
The
phial,
to
which
I
next
turned
my
attention,
might
have
been
about
half
full
of
a
blood-red
liquor,
which
was
highly
pungent
to
the
sense
of
smell
and
seemed
to
me
to
contain
phosphorus
and
some
volatile
ether.
At
the
other
ingredients
I
could
make
no
guess.
The
book
was
an
ordinary
version
book
and
contained
little
but
a
series
of
dates.
These
covered
a
period
of
many
years,
but
I
observed
that
the
entries
ceased
nearly
a
year
ago
and
quite
abruptly.
Here
and
there
a
brief
remark
was
appended
to
a
date,
usually
no
more
than
a
single
word:
“double”
occurring
perhaps
six
times
in
a
total
of
several
hundred
entries;
and
once
very
early
in
the
list
and

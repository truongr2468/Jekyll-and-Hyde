and
effulgence
of
certain
of
the
powers
that
made
up
my
spirit,
but
managed
to
compound
a
drug
by
which
these
powers
should
be
dethroned
from
their
supremacy,
and
a
second
form
and
countenance
substituted,
none
the
less
natural
to
me
because
they
were
the
expression,
and
bore
the
stamp
of
lower
elements
in
my
soul.
I
hesitated
long
before
I
put
this
theory
to
the
test
of
practice.
I
knew
well
that
I
risked
death;
for
any
drug
that
so
potently
controlled
and
shook
the
very
fortress
of
identity,
might,
by
the
least
scruple
of
an
overdose
or
at
the
least
inopportunity
in
the
moment
of
exhibition,
utterly
blot
out
that
immaterial
tabernacle
which
I
looked
to
it
to
change.
But
the
temptation
of
a
discovery
so
singular
and
profound
at
last
overcame
the
suggestions
of
alarm.
I
had
long
since
prepared
my
tincture;
I
purchased
at
once,
from
a
firm
of
wholesale
chemists,
a
large
quantity
of
a
particular
salt
which
I
knew,
from
my
experiments,
to
be
the
last
ingredient
required;
and
late
one
accursed
night,
I
compounded
the
elements,
watched
them
boil
and
smoke
together
in
the
glass,
and
when
the
ebullition
had
subsided,
with
a
strong
glow
of
courage,
drank
off
the
potion.
The
most
racking
pangs
succeeded:
a
grinding
in
the
bones,
deadly
nausea,
and
a
horror
of
the
spirit
that
cannot
be
exceeded
at
the
hour
of
birth
or
death.
Then
these
agonies
began
swiftly
to
subside,
and
I
came
to
myself
as

praises
of
conscience
began
to
grow
into
a
thing
of
course;
I
began
to
be
tortured
with
throes
and
longings,
as
of
Hyde
struggling
after
freedom;
and
at
last,
in
an
hour
of
moral
weakness,
I
once
again
compounded
and
swallowed
the
transforming
draught.
I
do
not
suppose
that,
when
a
drunkard
reasons
with
himself
upon
his
vice,
he
is
once
out
of
five
hundred
times
affected
by
the
dangers
that
he
runs
through
his
brutish,
physical
insensibility;
neither
had
I,
long
as
I
had
considered
my
position,
made
enough
allowance
for
the
complete
moral
insensibility
and
insensate
readiness
to
evil,
which
were
the
leading
characters
of
Edward
Hyde.
Yet
it
was
by
these
that
I
was
punished.
My
devil
had
been
long
caged,
he
came
out
roaring.
I
was
conscious,
even
when
I
took
the
draught,
of
a
more
unbridled,
a
more
furious
propensity
to
ill.
It
must
have
been
this,
I
suppose,
that
stirred
in
my
soul
that
tempest
of
impatience
with
which
I
listened
to
the
civilities
of
my
unhappy
victim;
I
declare,
at
least,
before
God,
no
man
morally
sane
could
have
been
guilty
of
that
crime
upon
so
pitiful
a
provocation;
and
that
I
struck
in
no
more
reasonable
spirit
than
that
in
which
a
sick
child
may
break
a
plaything.
But
I
had
voluntarily
stripped
myself
of
all
those
balancing
instincts
by
which
even
the
worst
of
us
continues
to
walk
with
some
degree
of
steadiness
among
temptations;
and
in
my
case,
to
be

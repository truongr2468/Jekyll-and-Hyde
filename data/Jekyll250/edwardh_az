down
upon
her
box,
which
stood
immediately
under
the
window,
and
fell
into
a
dream
of
musing.
Never
(she
used
to
say,
with
streaming
tears,
when
she
narrated
that
experience),
never
had
she
felt
more
at
peace
with
all
men
or
thought
more
kindly
of
the
world.
And
as
she
so
sat
she
became
aware
of
an
aged
beautiful
gentleman
with
white
hair,
drawing
near
along
the
lane;
and
advancing
to
meet
him,
another
and
very
small
gentleman,
to
whom
at
first
she
paid
less
attention.
When
they
had
come
within
speech
(which
was
just
under
the
maidâ€™s
eyes)
the
older
man
bowed
and
accosted
the
other
with
a
very
pretty
manner
of
politeness.
It
did
not
seem
as
if
the
subject
of
his
address
were
of
great
importance;
indeed,
from
his
pointing,
it
some
times
appeared
as
if
he
were
only
inquiring
his
way;
but
the
moon
shone
on
his
face
as
he
spoke,
and
the
girl
was
pleased
to
watch
it,
it
seemed
to
breathe
such
an
innocent
and
old-world
kindness
of
disposition,
yet
with
something
high
too,
as
of
a
well-founded
self-content.
Presently
her
eye
wandered
to
the
other,
and
she
was
surprised
to
recognise
in
him
a
certain
Mr.
Hyde,
who
had
once
visited
her
master
and
for
whom
she
had
conceived
a
dislike.
He
had
in
his
hand
a
heavy
cane,
with
which
he
was
trifling;
but
he
answered
never
a
word,
and
seemed
to
listen
with
an
ill-contained
impatience.
And
then
all
of
a

breakfast,
drinking
the
chill
of
the
air
with
pleasure,
when
I
was
seized
again
with
those
indescribable
sensations
that
heralded
the
change;
and
I
had
but
the
time
to
gain
the
shelter
of
my
cabinet,
before
I
was
once
again
raging
and
freezing
with
the
passions
of
Hyde.
It
took
on
this
occasion
a
double
dose
to
recall
me
to
myself;
and
alas!
six
hours
after,
as
I
sat
looking
sadly
in
the
fire,
the
pangs
returned,
and
the
drug
had
to
be
re-administered.
In
short,
from
that
day
forth
it
seemed
only
by
a
great
effort
as
of
gymnastics,
and
only
under
the
immediate
stimulation
of
the
drug,
that
I
was
able
to
wear
the
countenance
of
Jekyll.
At
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night,
I
would
be
taken
with
the
premonitory
shudder;
above
all,
if
I
slept,
or
even
dozed
for
a
moment
in
my
chair,
it
was
always
as
Hyde
that
I
awakened.
Under
the
strain
of
this
continually
impending
doom
and
by
the
sleeplessness
to
which
I
now
condemned
myself,
ay,
even
beyond
what
I
had
thought
possible
to
man,
I
became,
in
my
own
person,
a
creature
eaten
up
and
emptied
by
fever,
languidly
weak
both
in
body
and
mind,
and
solely
occupied
by
one
thought:
the
horror
of
my
other
self.
But
when
I
slept,
or
when
the
virtue
of
the
medicine
wore
off,
I
would
leap
almost
without
transition
(for
the
pangs
of
transformation
grew
daily
less
marked)
into
the
possession
of

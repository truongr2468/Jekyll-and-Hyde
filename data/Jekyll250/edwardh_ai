which
is
generally
smoking;
so
somebody
must
live
there.
And
yet
it’s
not
so
sure;
for
the
buildings
are
so
packed
together
about
the
court,
that
it’s
hard
to
say
where
one
ends
and
another
begins.”
The
pair
walked
on
again
for
a
while
in
silence;
and
then
“Enfield,”
said
Mr.
Utterson,
“that’s
a
good
rule
of
yours.”
“Yes,
I
think
it
is,”
returned
Enfield.
“But
for
all
that,”
continued
the
lawyer,
“there’s
one
point
I
want
to
ask:
I
want
to
ask
the
name
of
that
man
who
walked
over
the
child.”
“Well,”
said
Mr.
Enfield,
“I
can’t
see
what
harm
it
would
do.
It
was
a
man
of
the
name
of
Hyde.”
“Hm,”
said
Mr.
Utterson.
“What
sort
of
a
man
is
he
to
see?”
“He
is
not
easy
to
describe.
There
is
something
wrong
with
his
appearance;
something
displeasing,
something
down-right
detestable.
I
never
saw
a
man
I
so
disliked,
and
yet
I
scarce
know
why.
He
must
be
deformed
somewhere;
he
gives
a
strong
feeling
of
deformity,
although
I
couldn’t
specify
the
point.
He’s
an
extraordinary
looking
man,
and
yet
I
really
can
name
nothing
out
of
the
way.
No,
sir;
I
can
make
no
hand
of
it;
I
can’t
describe
him.
And
it’s
not
want
of
memory;
for
I
declare
I
can
see
him
this
moment.”
Mr.
Utterson
again
walked
some
way
in
silence
and
obviously
under
a
weight
of
consideration.
“You
are
sure
he
used
a
key?”
he
inquired
at
last.
“My
dear
sir...”

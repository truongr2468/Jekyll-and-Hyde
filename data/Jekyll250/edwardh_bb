he
had
no
sooner
seen
it
and
been
told
the
circumstances,
than
he
shot
out
a
solemn
lip.
“I
shall
say
nothing
till
I
have
seen
the
body,”
said
he;
“this
may
be
very
serious.
Have
the
kindness
to
wait
while
I
dress.”
And
with
the
same
grave
countenance
he
hurried
through
his
breakfast
and
drove
to
the
police
station,
whither
the
body
had
been
carried.
As
soon
as
he
came
into
the
cell,
he
nodded.
“Yes,”
said
he,
“I
recognise
him.
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
this
is
Sir
Danvers
Carew.”
“Good
God,
sir,”
exclaimed
the
officer,
“is
it
possible?”
And
the
next
moment
his
eye
lighted
up
with
professional
ambition.
“This
will
make
a
deal
of
noise,”
he
said.
“And
perhaps
you
can
help
us
to
the
man.”
And
he
briefly
narrated
what
the
maid
had
seen,
and
showed
the
broken
stick.
Mr.
Utterson
had
already
quailed
at
the
name
of
Hyde;
but
when
the
stick
was
laid
before
him,
he
could
doubt
no
longer;
broken
and
battered
as
it
was,
he
recognized
it
for
one
that
he
had
himself
presented
many
years
before
to
Henry
Jekyll.
“Is
this
Mr.
Hyde
a
person
of
small
stature?”
he
inquired.
“Particularly
small
and
particularly
wicked-looking,
is
what
the
maid
calls
him,”
said
the
officer.
Mr.
Utterson
reflected;
and
then,
raising
his
head,
“If
you
will
come
with
me
in
my
cab,”
he
said,
“I
think
I
can
take
you
to
his
house.”
It
was
by
this
time

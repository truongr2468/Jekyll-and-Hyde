to
force
our
way
into
the
cabinet.
If
all
is
well,
my
shoulders
are
broad
enough
to
bear
the
blame.
Meanwhile,
lest
anything
should
really
be
amiss,
or
any
malefactor
seek
to
escape
by
the
back,
you
and
the
boy
must
go
round
the
corner
with
a

your
stations.”

“And

London
hummed
solemnly

a
footfall
moving
to

along
the
cabinet

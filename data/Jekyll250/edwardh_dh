in
the
person
of
your
kinsman;
the
doctor
and
the
childâ€™s
family
joined
him;
there
were
moments
when
I
feared
for
my
life;
and
at
last,
in
order
to
pacify
their
too
just
resentment,
Edward
Hyde
had
to
bring
them
to
the
door,
and
pay
them
in
a
cheque
drawn
in
the
name
of
Henry
Jekyll.
But
this
danger
was
easily
eliminated
from
the
future,
by
opening
an
account
at
another
bank
in
the
name
of
Edward
Hyde
himself;
and
when,
by
sloping
my
own
hand
backward,
I
had
supplied
my
double
with
a
signature,
I
thought
I
sat
beyond
the
reach
of
fate.
Some
two
months
before
the
murder
of
Sir
Danvers,
I
had
been
out
for
one
of
my
adventures,
had
returned
at
a
late
hour,
and
woke
the
next
day
in
bed
with
somewhat
odd
sensations.
It
was
in
vain
I
looked
about
me;
in
vain
I
saw
the
decent
furniture
and
tall
proportions
of
my
room
in
the
square;
in
vain
that
I
recognised
the
pattern
of
the
bed
curtains
and
the
design
of
the
mahogany
frame;
something
still
kept
insisting
that
I
was
not
where
I
was,
that
I
had
not
wakened
where
I
seemed
to
be,
but
in
the
little
room
in
Soho
where
I
was
accustomed
to
sleep
in
the
body
of
Edward
Hyde.
I
smiled
to
myself,
and
in
my
psychological
way,
began
lazily
to
inquire
into
the
elements
of
this
illusion,
occasionally,
even
as
I
did
so,
dropping
back
into
a

shoulders.
Strange
to
relate,
this
ludicrous
accoutrement
was
far
from
moving
me
to
laughter.
Rather,
as
there
was
something
abnormal
and
misbegotten
in
the
very
essence
of
the
creature
that
now
faced
me--something
seizing,
surprising
and
revolting--this
fresh
disparity
seemed
but
to
fit
in
with
and
to
reinforce
it;
so
that
to
my
interest
in
the
man’s
nature
and
character,
there
was
added
a
curiosity
as
to
his
origin,
his
life,
his
fortune
and
status
in
the
world.
These
observations,
though
they
have
taken
so
great
a
space
to
be
set
down
in,
were
yet
the
work
of
a
few
seconds.
My
visitor
was,
indeed,
on
fire
with
sombre
excitement.
“Have
you
got
it?”
he
cried.
“Have
you
got
it?”
And
so
lively
was
his
impatience
that
he
even
laid
his
hand
upon
my
arm
and
sought
to
shake
me.
I
put
him
back,
conscious
at
his
touch
of
a
certain
icy
pang
along
my
blood.
“Come,
sir,”
said
I.
“You
forget
that
I
have
not
yet
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance.
Be
seated,
if
you
please.”
And
I
showed
him
an
example,
and
sat
down
myself
in
my
customary
seat
and
with
as
fair
an
imitation
of
my
ordinary
manner
to
a
patient,
as
the
lateness
of
the
hour,
the
nature
of
my
preoccupations,
and
the
horror
I
had
of
my
visitor,
would
suffer
me
to
muster.
“I
beg
your
pardon,
Dr.
Lanyon,”
he
replied
civilly
enough.
“What
you
say
is
very
well
founded;
and
my
impatience
has

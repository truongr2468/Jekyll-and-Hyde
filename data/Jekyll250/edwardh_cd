key
with
him?
But
that’s
not
all.
I
don’t
know,
Mr.
Utterson,
if
you
ever
met
this
Mr.
Hyde?”
“Yes,”
said
the
lawyer,
“I
once
spoke
with
him.”
“Then
you
must
know
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
that
there
was
something
queer
about
that
gentleman--something
that
gave
a
man
a
turn--I
don’t
know
rightly
how
to
say
it,
sir,
beyond
this:
that
you
felt
in
your
marrow
kind
of
cold
and
thin.”
“I
own
I
felt
something
of
what
you
describe,”
said
Mr.
Utterson.
“Quite
so,
sir,”
returned
Poole.
“Well,
when
that
masked
thing
like
a
monkey
jumped
from
among
the
chemicals
and
whipped
into
the
cabinet,
it
went
down
my
spine
like
ice.
O,
I
know
it’s
not

Mr.
Utterson;
I’m
book-learned
enough
for
that;
but
a
man
has
his
feelings,
and
I
give
you
my
bible-word
it
was
Mr.
Hyde!”
“Ay,
ay,”
said
the
lawyer.
“My
fears
incline
to
the
same
point.
Evil,
I
fear,
founded--evil
was
sure
to
come--of
that
connection.
Ay
truly,
I
believe
you;
I
believe
poor
Harry
is
killed;
and
I
believe
his
murderer
(for
what
purpose,
God
alone
can
tell)
is
still
lurking
in
his
victim’s
room.
Well,
let
our
name
be
vengeance.
Call
Bradshaw.”
The
footman
came
at
the
summons,
very
white
and
nervous.
“Put
yourself
together,
Bradshaw,”
said
the
lawyer.
“This
suspense,
I
know,
is
telling
upon
all
of
you;
but
it
is
now
our
intention
to
make
an
end
of
it.
Poole,
here,
and
I

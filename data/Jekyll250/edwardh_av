poor
Jekyll’s
worst
would
be
like
sunshine.
Things
cannot
continue
as
they
are.
It
turns
me
cold
to
think
of
this
creature
stealing
like
a
thief
to
Harry’s
bedside;
poor
Harry,
what
a
wakening!
And
the
danger
of
it;
for
if
this
Hyde
suspects
the
existence
of
the
will,
he
may
grow
impatient
to
inherit.
Ay,
I
must
put
my
shoulders
to
the
wheel--if
Jekyll
will
but
let
me,”
he
added,
“if
Jekyll
will
only
let
me.”
For
once
more
he
saw
before
his
mind’s
eye,
as
clear
as
transparency,
the
strange
clauses
of
the
will.
DR.
JEKYLL
WAS
QUITE
AT
EASE
A
fortnight
later,
by
excellent
good
fortune,
the
doctor
gave
one
of
his
pleasant
dinners
to
some
five
or
six
old
cronies,
all
intelligent,
reputable
men
and
all
judges
of
good
wine;
and
Mr.
Utterson
so
contrived
that
he
remained
behind
after
the
others
had
departed.
This
was
no
new
arrangement,
but
a
thing
that
had
befallen
many
scores
of
times.
Where
Utterson
was
liked,
he
was
liked
well.
Hosts
loved
to
detain
the
dry
lawyer,
when
the
light-hearted
and
loose-tongued
had
already
their
foot
on
the
threshold;
they
liked
to
sit
a
while
in
his
unobtrusive
company,
practising
for
solitude,
sobering
their
minds
in
the
man’s
rich
silence
after
the
expense
and
strain
of
gaiety.
To
this
rule,
Dr.
Jekyll
was
no
exception;
and
as
he
now
sat
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire--a
large,
well-made,
smooth-faced
man
of
fifty,
with
something
of
a
stylish
cast

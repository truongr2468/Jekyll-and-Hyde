that,
when
I
was
unable
to
conceal
the
alteration
in
my
stature?
And
then
with
an
overpowering
sweetness
of
relief,
it
came
back
upon
my
mind
that
the
servants
were
already
used
to
the
coming
and
going
of
my
second
self.
I
had
soon
dressed,
as
well
as
I
was
able,
in
clothes
of
my
own
size:
had
soon
passed
through
the
house,
where
Bradshaw
stared
and
drew
back
at
seeing
Mr.
Hyde
at
such
an
hour
and
in
such
a
strange
array;
and
ten
minutes
later,
Dr.
Jekyll
had
returned
to
his
own
shape
and
was
sitting
down,
with
a
darkened
brow,
to
make
a
feint
of
breakfasting.
Small
indeed
was
my
appetite.
This
inexplicable
incident,
this
reversal
of
my
previous
experience,
seemed,
like
the
Babylonian
finger
on
the
wall,
to
be
spelling
out
the
letters
of
my
judgment;
and
I
began
to
reflect
more
seriously
than
ever
before
on
the
issues
and
possibilities
of
my
double
existence.
That
part
of
me
which
I
had
the
power
of
projecting,
had
lately
been
much
exercised
and
nourished;
it
had
seemed
to
me
of
late
as
though
the
body
of
Edward
Hyde
had
grown
in
stature,
as
though
(when
I
wore
that
form)
I
were
conscious
of
a
more
generous
tide
of
blood;
and
I
began
to
spy
a
danger
that,
if
this
were
much
prolonged,
the
balance
of
my
nature
might
be
permanently
overthrown,
the
power
of
voluntary
change
be
forfeited,
and
the
character
of
Edward
Hyde
become
irrevocably
mine.

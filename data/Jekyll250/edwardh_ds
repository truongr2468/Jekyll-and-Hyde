dragged
him
from
his
perch.
At
the
inn,
as
I
entered,
I
looked
about
me
with
so
black
a
countenance
as
made
the
attendants
tremble;
not
a
look
did
they
exchange
in
my
presence;
but
obsequiously
took
my
orders,
led
me
to
a
private
room,
and
brought
me
wherewithal
to
write.
Hyde
in
danger
of
his
life
was
a
creature
new
to
me;
shaken
with
inordinate
anger,
strung
to
the
pitch
of
murder,
lusting
to
inflict
pain.
Yet
the
creature
was
astute;
mastered
his
fury
with
a
great
effort
of
the
will;
composed
his
two
important
letters,
one
to
Lanyon
and
one
to
Poole;
and
that
he
might
receive
actual
evidence
of
their
being
posted,
sent
them
out
with
directions
that
they
should
be
registered.
Thenceforward,
he
sat
all
day
over
the
fire
in
the
private
room,
gnawing
his
nails;
there
he
dined,
sitting
alone
with
his
fears,
the
waiter
visibly
quailing
before
his
eye;
and
thence,
when
the
night
was
fully
come,
he
set
forth
in
the
corner
of
a
closed
cab,
and
was
driven
to
and
fro
about
the
streets
of
the
city.
He,
I
say--I
cannot
say,
I.
That
child
of
Hell
had
nothing
human;
nothing
lived
in
him
but
fear
and
hatred.
And
when
at
last,
thinking
the
driver
had
begun
to
grow
suspicious,
he
discharged
the
cab
and
ventured
on
foot,
attired
in
his
misfitting
clothes,
an
object
marked
out
for
observation,
into
the
midst
of
the
nocturnal
passengers,
these
two
base
passions
raged
within

Utterson
was
sitting
by
his
fireside
one
evening
after
dinner,
when
he
was
surprised
to
receive
a
visit
from
Poole.
“Bless
me,
Poole,
what
brings
you
here?”
he
cried;
and
then
taking
a
second
look
at
him,
“What
ails
you?”
he
added;
“is
the
doctor
ill?”
“Mr.
Utterson,”
said
the
man,
“there
is
something
wrong.”
“Take
a
seat,
and
here
is
a
glass
of
wine
for
you,”
said
the
lawyer.
“Now,
take
your
time,
and
tell
me
plainly
what
you
want.”
“You
know
the
doctor’s
ways,
sir,”
replied
Poole,
“and
how
he
shuts
himself
up.
Well,
he’s
shut
up
again
in
the
cabinet;
and
I
don’t
like
it,
sir--I
wish
I
may
die
if
I
like
it.
Mr.
Utterson,
sir,
I’m
afraid.”
“Now,
my
good
man,”
said
the
lawyer,
“be
explicit.
What
are
you
afraid
of?”
“I’ve
been
afraid
for
about
a
week,”
returned
Poole,
doggedly
disregarding
the
question,
“and
I
can
bear
it
no
more.”
The
man’s
appearance
amply
bore
out
his
words;
his
manner
was
altered
for
the
worse;
and
except
for
the
moment
when
he
had
first
announced
his
terror,
he
had
not
once
looked
the
lawyer
in
the
face.
Even
now,
he
sat
with
the
glass
of
wine
untasted
on
his
knee,
and
his
eyes
directed
to
a
corner
of
the
floor.
“I
can
bear
it
no
more,”
he
repeated.
“Come,”
said
the
lawyer,
“I
see
you
have
some
good
reason,
Poole;
I
see
there
is
something
seriously
amiss.
Try
to
tell
me
what
it
is.”

many
different
nationalities
passing
out,
key
in
hand,
to
have
a
morning
glass;
and
the
next
moment
the
fog
settled
down
again
upon
that
part,
as
brown
as
umber,
and
cut
him
off
from
his
blackguardly
surroundings.
This
was
the
home
of
Henry
Jekyll’s
favourite;
of
a
man
who
was
heir
to
a
quarter
of
a
million
sterling.
An
ivory-faced
and
silvery-haired
old
woman
opened
the
door.
She
had
an
evil
face,
smoothed
by
hypocrisy:
but
her
manners
were
excellent.
Yes,
she
said,
this
was
Mr.
Hyde’s,
but
he
was
not
at
home;
he
had
been
in
that
night
very
late,
but
he
had
gone
away
again
in
less
than
an
hour;
there
was
nothing
strange
in
that;
his
habits
were
very
irregular,
and
he
was
often
absent;
for
instance,
it
was
nearly
two
months
since
she
had
seen
him
till
yesterday.
“Very
well,
then,
we
wish
to
see
his
rooms,”
said
the
lawyer;
and
when
the
woman
began
to
declare
it
was
impossible,
“I
had
better
tell
you
who
this
person
is,”
he
added.
“This
is
Inspector
Newcomen
of
Scotland
Yard.”
A
flash
of
odious
joy
appeared
upon
the
woman’s
face.
“Ah!”
said
she,
“he
is
in
trouble!
What
has
he
done?”
Mr.
Utterson
and
the
inspector
exchanged
glances.
“He
don’t
seem
a
very
popular
character,”
observed
the
latter.
“And
now,
my
good
woman,
just
let
me
and
this
gentleman
have
a
look
about
us.”
In
the
whole
extent
of
the
house,
which
but
for
the
old
woman
remained

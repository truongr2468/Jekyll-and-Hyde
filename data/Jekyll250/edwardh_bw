now
pulled
up
in
the
middle
of
the
pavement,
and
in
spite
of
the
biting
weather,
took
off
his
hat
and
mopped
his
brow
with
a
red
pocket-handkerchief.
But
for
all
the
hurry
of
his
coming,
these
were
not
the
dews
of
exertion
that
he
wiped
away,
but
the
moisture
of
some
strangling
anguish;
for
his
face
was
white
and
his
voice,
when
he
spoke,
harsh
and
broken.
“Well,
sir,”
he
said,
“here
we
are,
and
God
grant
there
be
nothing
wrong.”
“Amen,
Poole,”
said
the
lawyer.
Thereupon
the
servant
knocked
in
a
very
guarded
manner;
the
door
was
opened
on
the
chain;
and
a
voice
asked
from
within,
“Is
that
you,
Poole?”
“It’s
all
right,”
said
Poole.
“Open
the
door.”
The
hall,
when
they
entered
it,
was
brightly
lighted
up;
the
fire
was
built
high;
and
about
the
hearth
the
whole
of
the
servants,
men
and
women,
stood
huddled
together
like
a
flock
of
sheep.
At
the
sight
of
Mr.
Utterson,
the
housemaid
broke
into
hysterical
whimpering;
and
the
cook,
crying
out
“Bless
God!
it’s
Mr.
Utterson,”
ran
forward
as
if
to
take
him
in
her
arms.
“What,
what?
Are
you
all
here?”
said
the
lawyer
peevishly.
“Very
irregular,
very
unseemly;
your
master
would
be
far
from
pleased.”
“They’re
all
afraid,”
said
Poole.
Blank
silence
followed,
no
one
protesting;
only
the
maid
lifted
her
voice
and
now
wept
loudly.
“Hold
your
tongue!”
Poole
said
to
her,
with
a
ferocity
of
accent
that
testified
to
his
own
jangled
nerves;
and

it
in
with
Hyde,
was
to
die
to
a
thousand
interests
and
aspirations,
and
to
become,
at
a
blow
and
forever,
despised
and
friendless.
The
bargain
might
appear
unequal;
but
there
was
still
another
consideration
in
the
scales;
for
while
Jekyll
would
suffer
smartingly
in
the
fires
of
abstinence,
Hyde
would
be
not
even
conscious
of
all
that
he
had
lost.
Strange
as
my
circumstances
were,
the
terms
of
this
debate
are
as
old
and
commonplace
as
man;
much
the
same
inducements
and
alarms
cast
the
die
for
any
tempted
and
trembling
sinner;
and
it
fell
out
with
me,
as
it
falls
with
so
vast
a
majority
of
my
fellows,
that
I
chose
the
better
part
and
was
found
wanting
in
the
strength
to
keep
to
it.
Yes,
I
preferred
the
elderly
and
discontented
doctor,
surrounded
by
friends
and
cherishing
honest
hopes;
and
bade
a
resolute
farewell
to
the
liberty,
the
comparative
youth,
the
light
step,
leaping
impulses
and
secret
pleasures,
that
I
had
enjoyed
in
the
disguise
of
Hyde.
I
made
this
choice
perhaps
with
some
unconscious
reservation,
for
I
neither
gave
up
the
house
in
Soho,
nor
destroyed
the
clothes
of
Edward
Hyde,
which
still
lay
ready
in
my
cabinet.
For
two
months,
however,
I
was
true
to
my
determination;
for
two
months,
I
led
a
life
of
such
severity
as
I
had
never
before
attained
to,
and
enjoyed
the
compensations
of
an
approving
conscience.
But
time
began
at
last
to
obliterate
the
freshness
of
my
alarm;
the

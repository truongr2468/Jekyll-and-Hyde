of
those
maladies
that
both
torture
and
deform
the
sufferer;
hence,
for
aught
I
know,
the
alteration
of
his
voice;
hence
the
mask
and
the
avoidance
of
his
friends;
hence
his
eagerness
to
find
this
drug,
by
means
of
which
the
poor
soul
retains
some
hope
of
ultimate
recovery--God
grant
that
he
be
not
deceived!
There
is
my
explanation;
it
is
sad
enough,
Poole,
ay,
and
appalling
to
consider;
but
it
is
plain
and
natural,
hangs
well
together,
and
delivers
us
from
all
exorbitant
alarms.”
“Sir,”
said
the
butler,
turning
to
a
sort
of
mottled
pallor,
“that
thing
was
not
my
master,
and
there’s
the
truth.
My
master”--here
he
looked
round
him
and
began
to
whisper--“is
a
tall,
fine
build
of
a
man,
and
this
was
more
of
a
dwarf.”
Utterson
attempted
to
protest.
“O,
sir,”
cried
Poole,
“do
you
think
I
do
not
know
my
master
after
twenty
years?
Do
you
think
I
do
not
know
where
his
head
comes
to
in
the
cabinet
door,
where
I
saw
him
every
morning
of
my
life?
No,
sir,
that
thing
in
the
mask
was
never
Dr.
Jekyll--God
knows
what
it
was,
but
it
was
never
Dr.
Jekyll;
and
it
is
the
belief
of
my
heart
that
there
was
murder
done.”
“Poole,”
replied
the
lawyer,
“if
you
say
that,
it
will
become
my
duty
to
make
certain.
Much
as
I
desire
to
spare
your
master’s
feelings,
much
as
I
am
puzzled
by
this
note
which
seems
to
prove
him
to
be
still

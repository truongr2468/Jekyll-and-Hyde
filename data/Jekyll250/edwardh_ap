Mr.
Hyde,”
he
had
thought,
“I
shall
be
Mr.
Seek.”
And
at
last
his
patience
was
rewarded.
It
was
a
fine
dry
night;
frost
in
the
air;
the
streets
as
clean
as
a
ballroom
floor;
the
lamps,
unshaken
by
any
wind,
drawing
a
regular
pattern
of
light
and
shadow.
By
ten
o’clock,
when
the
shops
were
closed
the
by-street
was
very
solitary
and,
in
spite
of
the
low
growl
of
London
from
all
round,
very
silent.
Small
sounds
carried
far;
domestic
sounds
out
of
the
houses
were
clearly
audible
on
either
side
of
the
roadway;
and
the
rumour
of
the
approach
of
any
passenger
preceded
him
by
a
long
time.
Mr.
Utterson
had
been
some
minutes
at
his
post,
when
he
was
aware
of
an
odd
light
footstep
drawing
near.
In
the
course
of
his
nightly
patrols,
he
had
long
grown
accustomed
to
the
quaint
effect
with
which
the
footfalls
of
a
single
person,
while
he
is
still
a
great
way
off,
suddenly
spring
out
distinct
from
the
vast
hum
and
clatter
of
the
city.
Yet
his
attention
had
never
before
been
so
sharply
and
decisively
arrested;
and
it
was
with
a
strong,
superstitious
prevision
of
success
that
he
withdrew
into
the
entry
of
the
court.
The
steps
drew
swiftly
nearer,
and
swelled
out
suddenly
louder
as
they
turned
the
end
of
the
street.
The
lawyer,
looking
forth
from
the
entry,
could
soon
see
what
manner
of
man
he
had
to
deal
with.
He
was
small
and
very
plainly
dressed

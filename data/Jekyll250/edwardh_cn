You
should
be
back,
if
you
set
out
at
once
on
the
receipt
of
this,
long
before
midnight;
but
I
will
leave
you
that
amount
of
margin,
not
only
in
the
fear
of
one
of
those
obstacles
that
can
neither
be
prevented
nor
foreseen,
but
because
an
hour
when
your
servants
are
in
bed
is
to
be
preferred
for
what
will
then
remain
to
do.
At
midnight,
then,
I
have
to
ask
you
to
be
alone
in
your
consulting
room,
to
admit
with
your
own
hand
into
the
house
a
man
who
will
present
himself
in
my
name,
and
to
place
in
his
hands
the
drawer
that
you
will
have
brought
with
you
from
my
cabinet.
Then
you
will
have
played
your
part
and
earned
my
gratitude
completely.
Five
minutes
afterwards,
if
you
insist
upon
an
explanation,
you
will
have
understood
that
these
arrangements
are
of
capital
importance;
and
that
by
the
neglect
of
one
of
them,
fantastic
as
they
must
appear,
you
might
have
charged
your
conscience
with
my
death
or
the
shipwreck
of
my
reason.
â€œConfident
as
I
am
that
you
will
not
trifle
with
this
appeal,
my
heart
sinks
and
my
hand
trembles
at
the
bare
thought
of
such
a
possibility.
Think
of
me
at
this
hour,
in
a
strange
place,
labouring
under
a
blackness
of
distress
that
no
fancy
can
exaggerate,
and
yet
well
aware
that,
if
you
will
but
punctually
serve
me,
my
troubles
will
roll
away
like
a
story
that
is
told.
Serve
me,

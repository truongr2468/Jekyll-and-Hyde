upon
you,’
I
would
not
have
sacrificed
my
left
hand
to
help
you.
Lanyon
my
life,
my
honour,
my
reason,
are
all
at
your
mercy;
if
you
fail
me
to-night,
I
am
lost.
You
might
suppose,
after
this
preface,
that
I
am
going
to
ask
you
for
something
dishonourable
to
grant.
Judge
for
yourself.
“I
want
you
to
postpone
all
other
engagements
for
to-night--ay,
even
if
you
were
summoned
to
the
bedside
of
an
emperor;
to
take
a
cab,
unless
your
carriage
should
be
actually
at
the
door;
and
with
this
letter
in
your
hand
for
consultation,
to
drive
straight
to
my
house.
Poole,
my
butler,
has
his
orders;
you
will
find
him
waiting
your
arrival
with
a
locksmith.
The
door
of
my
cabinet
is
then
to
be
forced:
and
you
are
to
go
in
alone;
to
open
the
glazed
press
(letter
E)
on
the
left
hand,
breaking
the
lock
if
it
be
shut;
and
to
draw
out,
with
all
its
contents
as
they
stand,
the
fourth
drawer
from
the
top
or
(which
is
the
same
thing)
the
third
from
the
bottom.
In
my
extreme
distress
of
mind,
I
have
a
morbid
fear
of
misdirecting
you;
but
even
if
I
am
in
error,
you
may
know
the
right
drawer
by
its
contents:
some
powders,
a
phial
and
a
paper
book.
This
drawer
I
beg
of
you
to
carry
back
with
you
to
Cavendish
Square
exactly
as
it
stands.
“That
is
the
first
part
of
the
service:
now
for
the
second.

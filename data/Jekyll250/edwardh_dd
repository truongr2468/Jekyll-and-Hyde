doubtless
right.
I
have
observed
that
when
I
wore
the
semblance
of
Edward
Hyde,
none
could
come
near
to
me
at
first
without
a
visible
misgiving
of
the
flesh.
This,
as
I
take
it,
was
because
all
human
beings,
as
we
meet
them,
are
commingled
out
of
good
and
evil:
and
Edward
Hyde,
alone
in
the
ranks
of
mankind,
was
pure
evil.
I
lingered
but
a
moment
at
the
mirror:
the
second
and
conclusive
experiment
had
yet
to
be
attempted;
it
yet
remained
to
be
seen
if
I
had
lost
my
identity
beyond
redemption
and
must
flee
before
daylight
from
a
house
that
was
no
longer
mine;
and
hurrying
back
to
my
cabinet,
I
once
more
prepared
and
drank
the
cup,
once
more
suffered
the
pangs
of
dissolution,
and
came
to
myself
once
more
with
the
character,
the
stature
and
the
face
of
Henry
Jekyll.
That
night
I
had
come
to
the
fatal
cross-roads.
Had
I
approached
my
discovery
in
a
more
noble
spirit,
had
I
risked
the
experiment
while
under
the
empire
of
generous
or
pious
aspirations,
all
must
have
been
otherwise,
and
from
these
agonies
of
death
and
birth,
I
had
come
forth
an
angel
instead
of
a
fiend.
The
drug
had
no
discriminating
action;
it
was
neither
diabolical
nor
divine;
it
but
shook
the
doors
of
the
prisonhouse
of
my
disposition;
and
like
the
captives
of
Philippi,
that
which
stood
within
ran
forth.
At
that
time
my
virtue
slumbered;
my
evil,
kept
awake
by
ambition,
was
alert

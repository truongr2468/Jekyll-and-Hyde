this
consciousness
of
the
perennial
war
among
my
members.
With
every
day,
and
from
both
sides
of
my
intelligence,
the
moral
and
the
intellectual,
I
thus
drew
steadily
nearer
to
that
truth,
by
whose
partial
discovery
I
have
been
doomed
to
such
a
dreadful
shipwreck:
that
man
is
not
truly
one,
but
truly
two.
I
say
two,
because
the
state
of
my
own
knowledge
does
not
pass
beyond
that
point.
Others
will
follow,
others
will
outstrip
me
on
the
same
lines;
and
I
hazard
the
guess
that
man
will
be
ultimately
known
for
a
mere
polity
of
multifarious,
incongruous
and
independent
denizens.
I,
for
my
part,
from
the
nature
of
my
life,
advanced
infallibly
in
one
direction
and
in
one
direction
only.
It
was
on
the
moral
side,
and
in
my
own
person,
that
I
learned
to
recognise
the
thorough
and
primitive
duality
of
man;
I
saw
that,
of
the
two
natures
that
contended
in
the
field
of
my
consciousness,
even
if
I
could
rightly
be
said
to
be
either,
it
was
only
because
I
was
radically
both;
and
from
an
early
date,
even
before
the
course
of
my
scientific
discoveries
had
begun
to
suggest
the
most
naked
possibility
of
such
a
miracle,
I
had
learned
to
dwell
with
pleasure,
as
a
beloved
daydream,
on
the
thought
of
the
separation
of
these
elements.
If
each,
I
told
myself,
could
be
housed
in
separate
identities,
life
would
be
relieved
of
all
that
was
unbearable;
the
unjust
might
go
his
way,
delivered

a
part
instead
of
a
person;
but
he
loathed
the
necessity,
he
loathed
the
despondency
into
which
Jekyll
was
now
fallen,
and
he
resented
the
dislike
with
which
he
was
himself
regarded.
Hence
the
ape-like
tricks
that
he
would
play
me,
scrawling
in
my
own
hand
blasphemies
on
the
pages
of
my
books,
burning
the
letters
and
destroying
the
portrait
of
my
father;
and
indeed,
had
it
not
been
for
his
fear
of
death,
he
would
long
ago
have
ruined
himself
in
order
to
involve
me
in
the
ruin.
But
his
love
of
me
is
wonderful;
I
go
further:
I,
who
sicken
and
freeze
at
the
mere
thought
of
him,
when
I
recall
the
abjection
and
passion
of
this
attachment,
and
when
I
know
how
he
fears
my
power
to
cut
him
off
by
suicide,
I
find
it
in
my
heart
to
pity
him.
It
is
useless,
and
the
time
awfully
fails
me,
to
prolong
this
description;
no
one
has
ever
suffered
such
torments,
let
that
suffice;
and
yet
even
to
these,
habit
brought--no,
not
alleviation--but
a
certain
callousness
of
soul,
a
certain
acquiescence
of
despair;
and
my
punishment
might
have
gone
on
for
years,
but
for
the
last
calamity
which
has
now
fallen,
and
which
has
finally
severed
me
from
my
own
face
and
nature.
My
provision
of
the
salt,
which
had
never
been
renewed
since
the
date
of
the
first
experiment,
began
to
run
low.
I
sent
out
for
a
fresh
supply
and
mixed
the
draught;
the
ebullition

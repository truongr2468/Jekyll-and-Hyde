turn
with
us.”
“You
are
very
good,”
sighed
the
other.
“I
should
like
to
very
much;
but
no,
no,
no,
it
is
quite
impossible;
I
dare
not.
But
indeed,
Utterson,
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you;
this
is
really
a
great
pleasure;
I
would
ask
you
and
Mr.
Enfield
up,
but
the
place
is
really
not
fit.”
“Why,
then,”
said
the
lawyer,
good-naturedly,
“the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
stay
down
here
and
speak
with
you
from
where
we
are.”
“That
is
just
what
I
was
about
to
venture
to
propose,”
returned
the
doctor
with
a
smile.
But
the
words
were
hardly
uttered,
before
the
smile
was
struck
out
of
his
face
and
succeeded
by
an
expression
of
such
abject
terror
and
despair,
as
froze
the
very
blood
of
the
two
gentlemen
below.
They
saw
it
but
for
a
glimpse
for
the
window
was
instantly
thrust
down;
but
that
glimpse
had
been
sufficient,
and
they
turned
and
left
the
court
without
a
word.
In
silence,
too,
they
traversed
the
by-street;
and
it
was
not
until
they
had
come
into
a
neighbouring
thoroughfare,
where
even
upon
a
Sunday
there
were
still
some
stirrings
of
life,
that
Mr.
Utterson
at
last
turned
and
looked
at
his
companion.
They
were
both
pale;
and
there
was
an
answering
horror
in
their
eyes.
“God
forgive
us,
God
forgive
us,”
said
Mr.
Utterson.
But
Mr.
Enfield
only
nodded
his
head
very
seriously,
and
walked
on
once
more
in
silence.
THE
LAST
NIGHT
Mr.

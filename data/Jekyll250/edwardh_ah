and
with
the
words
fell
into
a
vein
of
musing.
From
this
he
was
recalled
by
Mr.
Utterson
asking
rather
suddenly:
“And
you
don’t
know
if
the
drawer
of
the
cheque
lives
there?”
“A
likely
place,
isn’t
it?”
returned
Mr.
Enfield.
“But
I
happen
to
have
noticed
his
address;
he
lives
in
some
square
or
other.”
“And
you
never
asked
about
the--place
with
the
door?”
said
Mr.
Utterson.
“No,
sir:
I
had
a
delicacy,”
was
the
reply.
“I
feel
very
strongly
about
putting
questions;
it
partakes
too
much
of
the
style
of
the
day
of
judgment.
You
start
a
question,
and
it’s
like
starting
a
stone.
You
sit
quietly
on
the
top
of
a
hill;
and
away
the
stone
goes,
starting
others;
and
presently
some
bland
old
bird
(the
last
you
would
have
thought
of)
is
knocked
on
the
head
in
his
own
back
garden
and
the
family
have
to
change
their
name.
No
sir,
I
make
it
a
rule
of
mine:
the
more
it
looks
like
Queer
Street,
the
less
I
ask.”
“A
very
good
rule,
too,”
said
the
lawyer.
“But
I
have
studied
the
place
for
myself,”
continued
Mr.
Enfield.
“It
seems
scarcely
a
house.
There
is
no
other
door,
and
nobody
goes
in
or
out
of
that
one
but,
once
in
a
great
while,
the
gentleman
of
my
adventure.
There
are
three
windows
looking
on
the
court
on
the
first
floor;
none
below;
the
windows
are
always
shut
but
they’re
clean.
And
then
there
is
a
chimney

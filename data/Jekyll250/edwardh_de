and
swift
to
seize
the
occasion;
and
the
thing
that
was
projected
was
Edward
Hyde.
Hence,
although
I
had
now
two
characters
as
well
as
two
appearances,
one
was
wholly
evil,
and
the
other
was
still
the
old
Henry
Jekyll,
that
incongruous
compound
of
whose
reformation
and
improvement
I
had
already
learned
to
despair.
The
movement
was
thus
wholly
toward
the
worse.
Even
at
that
time,
I
had
not
conquered
my
aversions
to
the
dryness
of
a
life
of
study.
I
would
still
be
merrily
disposed
at
times;
and
as
my
pleasures
were
(to
say
the
least)
undignified,
and
I
was
not
only
well
known
and
highly
considered,
but
growing
towards
the
elderly
man,
this
incoherency
of
my
life
was
daily
growing
more
unwelcome.
It
was
on
this
side
that
my
new
power
tempted
me
until
I
fell
in
slavery.
I
had
but
to
drink
the
cup,
to
doff
at
once
the
body
of
the
noted
professor,
and
to
assume,
like
a
thick
cloak,
that
of
Edward
Hyde.
I
smiled
at
the
notion;
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
to
be
humourous;
and
I
made
my
preparations
with
the
most
studious
care.
I
took
and
furnished
that
house
in
Soho,
to
which
Hyde
was
tracked
by
the
police;
and
engaged
as
a
housekeeper
a
creature
whom
I
knew
well
to
be
silent
and
unscrupulous.
On
the
other
side,
I
announced
to
my
servants
that
a
Mr.
Hyde
(whom
I
described)
was
to
have
full
liberty
and
power
about
my

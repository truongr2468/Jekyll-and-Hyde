you
will
perhaps
not
wonder
that
I
hear
you
with
no
very
strong
impression
of
belief.
But
I
have
gone
too
far
in
the
way
of
inexplicable
services
to
pause
before
I
see
the
end.”
“It
is
well,”
replied
my
visitor.
“Lanyon,
you
remember
your
vows:
what
follows
is
under
the
seal
of
our
profession.
And
now,
you
who
have
so
long
been
bound
to
the
most
narrow
and
material
views,
you
who
have
denied
the
virtue
of
transcendental
medicine,
you
who
have
derided
your
superiors--behold!”
He
put
the
glass
to
his
lips
and
drank
at
one
gulp.
A
cry
followed;
he
reeled,
staggered,
clutched
at
the
table
and
held
on,
staring
with
injected
eyes,
gasping
with
open
mouth;
and
as
I
looked
there
came,
I
thought,
a
change--he
seemed
to
swell--his
face
became
suddenly
black
and
the
features
seemed
to
melt
and
alter--and
the
next
moment,
I
had
sprung
to
my
feet
and
leaped
back
against
the
wall,
my
arms
raised
to
shield
me
from
that
prodigy,
my
mind
submerged
in
terror.
“O
God!”
I
screamed,
and
“O
God!”
again
and
again;
for
there
before
my
eyes--pale
and
shaken,
and
half
fainting,
and
groping
before
him
with
his
hands,
like
a
man
restored
from
death--there
stood
Henry
Jekyll!
What
he
told
me
in
the
next
hour,
I
cannot
bring
my
mind
to
set
on
paper.
I
saw
what
I
saw,
I
heard
what
I
heard,
and
my
soul
sickened
at
it;
and
yet
now
when
that
sight
has
faded

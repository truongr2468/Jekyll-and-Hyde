leaped
against
the
lock
and
hinges.
A
dismal
screech,
as
of
mere
animal
terror,
rang
from
the
cabinet.
Up
went
the
axe
again,
and
again
the
panels
crashed
and
the
frame
bounded;
four
times
the
blow
fell;
but
the
wood
was
tough
and
the
fittings
were
of
excellent
workmanship;
and
it
was
not
until
the
fifth,
that
the
lock
burst
and
the
wreck
of
the
door
fell
inwards
on
the
carpet.
The
besiegers,
appalled
by
their
own
riot
and
the
stillness
that
had
succeeded,
stood
back
a
little
and
peered
in.
There
lay
the
cabinet
before
their
eyes
in
the
quiet
lamplight,
a
good
fire
glowing
and
chattering
on
the
hearth,
the
kettle
singing
its
thin
strain,
a
drawer
or
two
open,
papers
neatly
set
forth
on
the
business
table,
and
nearer
the
fire,
the
things
laid
out
for
tea;
the
quietest
room,
you
would
have
said,
and,
but
for
the
glazed
presses
full
of
chemicals,
the
most
commonplace
that
night
in
London.
Right
in
the
middle
there
lay
the
body
of
a
man
sorely
contorted
and
still
twitching.
They
drew
near
on
tiptoe,
turned
it
on
its
back
and
beheld
the
face
of
Edward
Hyde.
He
was
dressed
in
clothes
far
too
large
for
him,
clothes
of
the
doctorâ€™s
bigness;
the
cords
of
his
face
still
moved
with
a
semblance
of
life,
but
life
was
quite
gone:
and
by
the
crushed
phial
in
the
hand
and
the
strong
smell
of
kernels
that
hung
upon
the
air,
Utterson
knew
that

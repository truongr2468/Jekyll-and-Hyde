a
husky,
whispering
and
somewhat
broken
voice;
all
these
were
points
against
him,
but
not
all
of
these
together
could
explain
the
hitherto
unknown
disgust,
loathing
and
fear
with
which
Mr.
Utterson
regarded
him.
“There
must
be
something
else,”
said
the
perplexed
gentleman.
“There
is
something
more,
if
I
could
find
a
name
for
it.
God
bless
me,
the
man
seems
hardly
human!
Something
troglodytic,
shall
we
say?
or
can
it
be
the
old
story
of
Dr.
Fell?
or
is
it
the
mere
radiance
of
a
foul
soul
that
thus
transpires
through,
and
transfigures,
its
clay
continent?
The
last,
I
think;
for,
O
my
poor
old
Harry
Jekyll,
if
ever
I
read
Satan’s
signature
upon
a
face,
it
is
on
that
of
your
new
friend.”
Round
the
corner
from
the
by-street,
there
was
a
square
of
ancient,
handsome
houses,
now
for
the
most
part
decayed
from
their
high
estate
and
let
in
flats
and
chambers
to
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men;
map-engravers,
architects,
shady
lawyers
and
the
agents
of
obscure
enterprises.
One
house,
however,
second
from
the
corner,
was
still
occupied
entire;
and
at
the
door
of
this,
which
wore
a
great
air
of
wealth
and
comfort,
though
it
was
now
plunged
in
darkness
except
for
the
fanlight,
Mr.
Utterson
stopped
and
knocked.
A
well-dressed,
elderly
servant
opened
the
door.
“Is
Dr.
Jekyll
at
home,
Poole?”
asked
the
lawyer.
“I
will
see,
Mr.
Utterson,”
said
Poole,
admitting
the
visitor,
as
he
spoke,
into
a
large,
low-roofed,
comfortable
hall

was
ready
to
be
set
free
and
to
disperse
the
fogs
of
London.
Insensibly
the
lawyer
melted.
There
was
no
man
from
whom
he
kept
fewer
secrets
than
Mr.
Guest;
and
he
was
not
always
sure
that
he
kept
as
many
as
he
meant.
Guest
had
often
been
on
business
to
the
doctor’s;
he
knew
Poole;
he
could
scarce
have
failed
to
hear
of
Mr.
Hyde’s
familiarity
about
the
house;
he
might
draw
conclusions:
was
it
not
as
well,
then,
that
he
should
see
a
letter
which
put
that
mystery
to
right?
and
above
all
since
Guest,
being
a
great
student
and
critic
of
handwriting,
would
consider
the
step
natural
and
obliging?
The
clerk,
besides,
was
a
man
of
counsel;
he
could
scarce
read
so
strange
a
document
without
dropping
a
remark;
and
by
that
remark
Mr.
Utterson
might
shape
his
future
course.
“This
is
a
sad
business
about
Sir
Danvers,”
he
said.
“Yes,
sir,
indeed.
It
has
elicited
a
great
deal
of
public
feeling,”
returned
Guest.
“The
man,
of
course,
was
mad.”
“I
should
like
to
hear
your
views
on
that,”
replied
Utterson.
“I
have
a
document
here
in
his
handwriting;
it
is
between
ourselves,
for
I
scarce
know
what
to
do
about
it;
it
is
an
ugly
business
at
the
best.
But
there
it
is;
quite
in
your
way:
a
murderer’s
autograph.”
Guest’s
eyes
brightened,
and
he
sat
down
at
once
and
studied
it
with
passion.
“No
sir,”
he
said:
“not
mad;
but
it
is
an
odd
hand.”

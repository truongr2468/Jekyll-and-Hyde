recover.
It
is
a
question
of
weeks.
Well,
life
has
been
pleasant;
I
liked
it;
yes,
sir,
I
used
to
like
it.
I
sometimes
think
if
we
knew
all,
we
should
be
more
glad
to
get
away.”
“Jekyll
is
ill,
too,”
observed
Utterson.
“Have
you
seen
him?”
But
Lanyon’s
face
changed,
and
he
held
up
a
trembling
hand.
“I
wish
to
see
or
hear
no
more
of
Dr.
Jekyll,”
he
said
in
a
loud,
unsteady
voice.
“I
am
quite
done
with
that
person;
and
I
beg
that
you
will
spare
me
any
allusion
to
one
whom
I
regard
as
dead.”
“Tut-tut,”
said
Mr.
Utterson;
and
then
after
a
considerable
pause,
“Can’t
I
do
anything?”
he
inquired.
“We
are
three
very
old
friends,
Lanyon;
we
shall
not
live
to
make
others.”
“Nothing
can
be
done,”
returned
Lanyon;
“ask
himself.”
“He
will
not
see
me,”
said
the
lawyer.
“I
am
not
surprised
at
that,”
was
the
reply.
“Some
day,
Utterson,
after
I
am
dead,
you
may
perhaps
come
to
learn
the
right
and
wrong
of
this.
I
cannot
tell
you.
And
in
the
meantime,
if
you
can
sit
and
talk
with
me
of
other
things,
for
God’s
sake,
stay
and
do
so;
but
if
you
cannot
keep
clear
of
this
accursed
topic,
then
in
God’s
name,
go,
for
I
cannot
bear
it.”
As
soon
as
he
got
home,
Utterson
sat
down
and
wrote
to
Jekyll,
complaining
of
his
exclusion
from
the
house,
and
asking
the
cause
of
this
unhappy
break
with
Lanyon;

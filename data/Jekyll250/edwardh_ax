doctor,
with
a
certain
incoherency
of
manner.
“I
am
painfully
situated,
Utterson;
my
position
is
a
very
strange--a
very
strange
one.
It
is
one
of
those
affairs
that
cannot
be
mended
by
talking.”
“Jekyll,”
said
Utterson,
“you
know
me:
I
am
a
man
to
be
trusted.
Make
a
clean
breast
of
this
in
confidence;
and
I
make
no
doubt
I
can
get
you
out
of
it.”
“My
good
Utterson,”
said
the
doctor,
“this
is
very
good
of
you,
this
is
downright
good
of
you,
and
I
cannot
find
words
to
thank
you
in.
I
believe
you
fully;
I
would
trust
you
before
any
man
alive,
ay,
before
myself,
if
I
could
make
the
choice;
but
indeed
it
isn’t
what
you
fancy;
it
is
not
as
bad
as
that;
and
just
to
put
your
good
heart
at
rest,
I
will
tell
you
one
thing:
the
moment
I
choose,
I
can
be
rid
of
Mr.
Hyde.
I
give
you
my
hand
upon
that;
and
I
thank
you
again
and
again;
and
I
will
just
add
one
little
word,
Utterson,
that
I’m
sure
you’ll
take
in
good
part:
this
is
a
private
matter,
and
I
beg
of
you
to
let
it
sleep.”
Utterson
reflected
a
little,
looking
in
the
fire.
“I
have
no
doubt
you
are
perfectly
right,”
he
said
at
last,
getting
to
his
feet.
“Well,
but
since
we
have
touched
upon
this
business,
and
for
the
last
time
I
hope,”
continued
the
doctor,
“there
is
one
point
I
should
like
you

Hyde
had
numbered
few
familiars--even
the
master
of
the
servant
maid
had
only
seen
him
twice;
his
family
could
nowhere
be
traced;
he
had
never
been
photographed;
and
the
few
who
could
describe
him
differed
widely,
as
common
observers
will.
Only
on
one
point
were
they
agreed;
and
that
was
the
haunting
sense
of
unexpressed
deformity
with
which
the
fugitive
impressed
his
beholders.
INCIDENT
OF
THE
LETTER
It
was
late
in
the
afternoon,
when
Mr.
Utterson
found
his
way
to
Dr.
Jekyll’s
door,
where
he
was
at
once
admitted
by
Poole,
and
carried
down
by
the
kitchen
offices
and
across
a
yard
which
had
once
been
a
garden,
to
the
building
which
was
indifferently
known
as
the
laboratory
or
dissecting
rooms.
The
doctor
had
bought
the
house
from
the
heirs
of
a
celebrated
surgeon;
and
his
own
tastes
being
rather
chemical
than
anatomical,
had
changed
the
destination
of
the
block
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden.
It
was
the
first
time
that
the
lawyer
had
been
received
in
that
part
of
his
friend’s
quarters;
and
he
eyed
the
dingy,
windowless
structure
with
curiosity,
and
gazed
round
with
a
distasteful
sense
of
strangeness
as
he
crossed
the
theatre,
once
crowded
with
eager
students
and
now
lying
gaunt
and
silent,
the
tables
laden
with
chemical
apparatus,
the
floor
strewn
with
crates
and
littered
with
packing
straw,
and
the
light
falling
dimly
through
the
foggy
cupola.
At
the
further
end,
a
flight
of
stairs
mounted
to
a
door
covered
with
red
baize;
and

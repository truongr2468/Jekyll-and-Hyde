me,
I
confess,
disagreeably;
and
as
I
followed
him
into
the
bright
light
of
the
consulting
room,
I
kept
my
hand
ready
on
my
weapon.
Here,
at
last,
I
had
a
chance
of
clearly
seeing
him.
I
had
never
set
eyes
on
him
before,
so
much
was
certain.
He
was
small,
as
I
have
said;
I
was
struck
besides
with
the
shocking
expression
of
his
face,
with
his
remarkable
combination
of
great
muscular
activity
and
great
apparent
debility
of
constitution,
and--last
but
not
least--with
the
odd,
subjective
disturbance
caused
by
his
neighbourhood.
This
bore
some
resemblance
to
incipient
rigour,
and
was
accompanied
by
a
marked
sinking
of
the
pulse.
At
the
time,
I
set
it
down
to
some
idiosyncratic,
personal
distaste,
and
merely
wondered
at
the
acuteness
of
the
symptoms;
but
I
have
since
had
reason
to
believe
the
cause
to
lie
much
deeper
in
the
nature
of
man,
and
to
turn
on
some
nobler
hinge
than
the
principle
of
hatred.
This
person
(who
had
thus,
from
the
first
moment
of
his
entrance,
struck
in
me
what
I
can
only
describe
as
a
disgustful
curiosity)
was
dressed
in
a
fashion
that
would
have
made
an
ordinary
person
laughable;
his
clothes,
that
is
to
say,
although
they
were
of
rich
and
sober
fabric,
were
enormously
too
large
for
him
in
every
measurement--the
trousers
hanging
on
his
legs
and
rolled
up
to
keep
them
from
the
ground,
the
waist
of
the
coat
below
his
haunches,
and
the
collar
sprawling
wide
upon
his

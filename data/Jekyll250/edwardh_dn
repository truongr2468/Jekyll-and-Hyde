tempted,
however
slightly,
was
to
fall.
Instantly
the
spirit
of
hell
awoke
in
me
and
raged.
With
a
transport
of
glee,
I
mauled
the
unresisting
body,
tasting
delight
from
every
blow;
and
it
was
not
till
weariness
had
begun
to
succeed,
that
I
was
suddenly,
in
the
top
fit
of
my
delirium,
struck
through
the
heart
by
a
cold
thrill
of
terror.
A
mist
dispersed;
I
saw
my
life
to
be
forfeit;
and
fled
from
the
scene
of
these
excesses,
at
once
glorying
and
trembling,
my
lust
of
evil
gratified
and
stimulated,
my
love
of
life
screwed
to
the
topmost
peg.
I
ran
to
the
house
in
Soho,
and
(to
make
assurance
doubly
sure)
destroyed
my
papers;
thence
I
set
out
through
the
lamplit
streets,
in
the
same
divided
ecstasy
of
mind,
gloating
on
my
crime,
light-headedly
devising
others
in
the
future,
and
yet
still
hastening
and
still
hearkening
in
my
wake
for
the
steps
of
the
avenger.
Hyde
had
a
song
upon
his
lips
as
he
compounded
the
draught,
and
as
he
drank
it,
pledged
the
dead
man.
The
pangs
of
transformation
had
not
done
tearing
him,
before
Henry
Jekyll,
with
streaming
tears
of
gratitude
and
remorse,
had
fallen
upon
his
knees
and
lifted
his
clasped
hands
to
God.
The
veil
of
self-indulgence
was
rent
from
head
to
foot.
I
saw
my
life
as
a
whole:
I
followed
it
up
from
the
days
of
childhood,
when
I
had
walked
with
my
fatherâ€™s
hand,
and
through
the
self-denying
toils
of

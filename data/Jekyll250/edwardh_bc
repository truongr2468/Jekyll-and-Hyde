in
the
morning,
and
the
first
fog
of
the
season.
A
great
chocolate-coloured
pall
lowered
over
heaven,
but
the
wind
was
continually
charging
and
routing
these
embattled
vapours;
so
that
as
the
cab
crawled
from
street
to
street,
Mr.
Utterson
beheld
a
marvelous
number
of
degrees
and
hues
of
twilight;
for
here
it
would
be
dark
like
the
back-end
of
evening;
and
there
would
be
a
glow
of
a
rich,
lurid
brown,
like
the
light
of
some
strange
conflagration;
and
here,
for
a
moment,
the
fog
would
be
quite
broken
up,
and
a
haggard
shaft
of
daylight
would
glance
in
between
the
swirling
wreaths.
The
dismal
quarter
of
Soho
seen
under
these
changing
glimpses,
with
its
muddy
ways,
and
slatternly
passengers,
and
its
lamps,
which
had
never
been
extinguished
or
had
been
kindled
afresh
to
combat
this
mournful
reinvasion
of
darkness,
seemed,
in
the
lawyer’s
eyes,
like
a
district
of
some
city
in
a
nightmare.
The
thoughts
of
his
mind,
besides,
were
of
the
gloomiest
dye;
and
when
he
glanced
at
the
companion
of
his
drive,
he
was
conscious
of
some
touch
of
that
terror
of
the
law
and
the
law’s
officers,
which
may
at
times
assail
the
most
honest.
As
the
cab
drew
up
before
the
address
indicated,
the
fog
lifted
a
little
and
showed
him
a
dingy
street,
a
gin
palace,
a
low
French
eating
house,
a
shop
for
the
retail
of
penny
numbers
and
twopenny
salads,
many
ragged
children
huddled
in
the
doorways,
and
many
women
of

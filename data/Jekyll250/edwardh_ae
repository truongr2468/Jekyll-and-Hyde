halloa,
took
to
my
heels,
collared
my
gentleman,
and
brought
him
back
to
where
there
was
already
quite
a
group
about
the
screaming
child.
He
was
perfectly
cool
and
made
no
resistance,
but
gave
me
one
look,
so
ugly
that
it
brought
out
the
sweat
on
me
like
running.
The
people
who
had
turned
out
were
the
girl’s
own
family;
and
pretty
soon,
the
doctor,
for
whom
she
had
been
sent
put
in
his
appearance.
Well,
the
child
was
not
much
the
worse,
more
frightened,
according
to
the
Sawbones;
and
there
you
might
have
supposed
would
be
an
end
to
it.
But
there
was
one
curious
circumstance.
I
had
taken
a
loathing
to
my
gentleman
at
first
sight.
So
had
the
child’s
family,
which
was
only
natural.
But
the
doctor’s
case
was
what
struck
me.
He
was
the
usual
cut
and
dry
apothecary,
of
no
particular
age
and
colour,
with
a
strong
Edinburgh
accent
and
about
as
emotional
as
a
bagpipe.
Well,
sir,
he
was
like
the
rest
of
us;
every
time
he
looked
at
my
prisoner,
I
saw
that
Sawbones
turn
sick
and
white
with
desire
to
kill
him.
I
knew
what
was
in
his
mind,
just
as
he
knew
what
was
in
mine;
and
killing
being
out
of
the
question,
we
did
the
next
best.
We
told
the
man
we
could
and
would
make
such
a
scandal
out
of
this
as
should
make
his
name
stink
from
one
end
of
London
to
the
other.
If
he
had
any

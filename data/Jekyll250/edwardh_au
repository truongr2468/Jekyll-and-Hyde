Utterson.
“O,
dear
no,
sir.
He
never
dines
here,”
replied
the
butler.
“Indeed
we
see
very
little
of
him
on
this
side
of
the
house;
he
mostly
comes
and
goes
by
the
laboratory.”
“Well,
good-night,
Poole.”
“Good-night,
Mr.
Utterson.”
And
the
lawyer
set
out
homeward
with
a
very
heavy
heart.
“Poor
Harry
Jekyll,”
he
thought,
“my
mind
misgives
me
he
is
in
deep
waters!
He
was
wild
when
he
was
young;
a
long
while
ago
to
be
sure;
but
in
the
law
of
God,
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations.
Ay,
it
must
be
that;
the
ghost
of
some
old
sin,
the
cancer
of
some
concealed
disgrace:
punishment
coming,
PEDE
CLAUDO,
years
after
memory
has
forgotten
and
self-love
condoned
the
fault.”
And
the
lawyer,
scared
by
the
thought,
brooded
awhile
on
his
own
past,
groping
in
all
the
corners
of
memory,
least
by
chance
some
Jack-in-the-Box
of
an
old
iniquity
should
leap
to
light
there.
His
past
was
fairly
blameless;
few
men
could
read
the
rolls
of
their
life
with
less
apprehension;
yet
he
was
humbled
to
the
dust
by
the
many
ill
things
he
had
done,
and
raised
up
again
into
a
sober
and
fearful
gratitude
by
the
many
he
had
come
so
near
to
doing
yet
avoided.
And
then
by
a
return
on
his
former
subject,
he
conceived
a
spark
of
hope.
“This
Master
Hyde,
if
he
were
studied,”
thought
he,
“must
have
secrets
of
his
own;
black
secrets,
by
the
look
of
him;
secrets
compared
to

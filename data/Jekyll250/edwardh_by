his
voice;
and
taking
up
his
candle,
he
led
Mr.
Utterson
back
across
the
yard
and
into
the
great
kitchen,
where
the
fire
was
out
and
the
beetles
were
leaping
on
the
floor.
“Sir,”
he
said,
looking
Mr.
Utterson
in
the
eyes,
“Was
that
my
master’s
voice?”
“It
seems
much
changed,”
replied
the
lawyer,
very
pale,
but
giving
look
for
look.
“Changed?
Well,
yes,
I
think
so,”
said
the
butler.
“Have
I
been
twenty
years
in
this
man’s
house,
to
be
deceived
about
his
voice?
No,
sir;
master’s
made
away
with;
he
was
made
away
with
eight
days
ago,
when
we
heard
him
cry
out
upon
the
name
of
God;
and
who’s
in
there
instead
of
him,
and
why
it
stays
there,
is
a
thing
that
cries
to
Heaven,
Mr.
Utterson!”
“This
is
a
very
strange
tale,
Poole;
this
is
rather
a
wild
tale
my
man,”
said
Mr.
Utterson,
biting
his
finger.
“Suppose
it
were
as
you
suppose,
supposing
Dr.
Jekyll
to
have
been--well,
murdered
what
could
induce
the
murderer
to
stay?
That
won’t
hold
water;
it
doesn’t
commend
itself
to
reason.”
“Well,
Mr.
Utterson,
you
are
a
hard
man
to
satisfy,
but
I’ll
do
it
yet,”
said
Poole.
“All
this
last
week
(you
must
know)
him,
or
it,
whatever
it
is
that
lives
in
that
cabinet,
has
been
crying
night
and
day
for
some
sort
of
medicine
and
cannot
get
it
to
his
mind.
It
was
sometimes
his
way--the
master’s,
that
is--to
write
his
orders
on
a
sheet

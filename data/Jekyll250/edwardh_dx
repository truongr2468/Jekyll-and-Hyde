followed,
and
the
first
change
of
colour,
not
the
second;
I
drank
it
and
it
was
without
efficiency.
You
will
learn
from
Poole
how
I
have
had
London
ransacked;
it
was
in
vain;
and
I
am
now
persuaded
that
my
first
supply
was
impure,
and
that
it
was
that
unknown
impurity
which
lent
efficacy
to
the
draught.
About
a
week
has
passed,
and
I
am
now
finishing
this
statement
under
the
influence
of
the
last
of
the
old
powders.
This,
then,
is
the
last
time,
short
of
a
miracle,
that
Henry
Jekyll
can
think
his
own
thoughts
or
see
his
own
face
(now
how
sadly
altered!)
in
the
glass.
Nor
must
I
delay
too
long
to
bring
my
writing
to
an
end;
for
if
my
narrative
has
hitherto
escaped
destruction,
it
has
been
by
a
combination
of
great
prudence
and
great
good
luck.
Should
the
throes
of
change
take
me
in
the
act
of
writing
it,
Hyde
will
tear
it
in
pieces;
but
if
some
time
shall
have
elapsed
after
I
have
laid
it
by,
his
wonderful
selfishness
and
circumscription
to
the
moment
will
probably
save
it
once
again
from
the
action
of
his
ape-like
spite.
And
indeed
the
doom
that
is
closing
on
us
both
has
already
changed
and
crushed
him.
Half
an
hour
from
now,
when
I
shall
again
and
forever
reindue
that
hated
personality,
I
know
how
I
shall
sit
shuddering
and
weeping
in
my
chair,
or
continue,
with
the
most
strained
and
fearstruck
ecstasy
of
listening,

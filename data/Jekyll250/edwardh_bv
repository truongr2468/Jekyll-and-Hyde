“I
think
there’s
been
foul
play,”
said
Poole,
hoarsely.
“Foul
play!”
cried
the
lawyer,
a
good
deal
frightened
and
rather
inclined
to
be
irritated
in
consequence.
“What
foul
play!
What
does
the
man
mean?”
“I
daren’t
say,
sir,”
was
the
answer;
“but
will
you
come
along
with
me
and
see
for
yourself?”
Mr.
Utterson’s
only
answer
was
to
rise
and
get
his
hat
and
greatcoat;
but
he
observed
with
wonder
the
greatness
of
the
relief
that
appeared
upon
the
butler’s
face,
and
perhaps
with
no
less,
that
the
wine
was
still
untasted
when
he
set
it
down
to
follow.
It
was
a
wild,
cold,
seasonable
night
of
March,
with
a
pale
moon,
lying
on
her
back
as
though
the
wind
had
tilted
her,
and
flying
wrack
of
the
most
diaphanous
and
lawny
texture.
The
wind
made
talking
difficult,
and
flecked
the
blood
into
the
face.
It
seemed
to
have
swept
the
streets
unusually
bare
of
passengers,
besides;
for
Mr.
Utterson
thought
he
had
never
seen
that
part
of
London
so
deserted.
He
could
have
wished
it
otherwise;
never
in
his
life
had
he
been
conscious
of
so
sharp
a
wish
to
see
and
touch
his
fellow-creatures;
for
struggle
as
he
might,
there
was
borne
in
upon
his
mind
a
crushing
anticipation
of
calamity.
The
square,
when
they
got
there,
was
full
of
wind
and
dust,
and
the
thin
trees
in
the
garden
were
lashing
themselves
along
the
railing.
Poole,
who
had
kept
all
the
way
a
pace
or
two
ahead,

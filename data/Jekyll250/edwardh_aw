perhaps,
but
every
mark
of
capacity
and
kindness--you
could
see
by
his
looks
that
he
cherished
for
Mr.
Utterson
a
sincere
and
warm
affection.
“I
have
been
wanting
to
speak
to
you,
Jekyll,”
began
the
latter.
“You
know
that
will
of
yours?”
A
close
observer
might
have
gathered
that
the
topic
was
distasteful;
but
the
doctor
carried
it
off
gaily.
“My
poor
Utterson,”
said
he,
“you
are
unfortunate
in
such
a
client.
I
never
saw
a
man
so
distressed
as
you
were
by
my
will;
unless
it
were
that
hide-bound
pedant,
Lanyon,
at
what
he
called
my
scientific
heresies.
O,
I
know
he’s
a
good
fellow--you
needn’t
frown--an
excellent
fellow,
and
I
always
mean
to
see
more
of
him;
but
a
hide-bound
pedant
for
all
that;
an
ignorant,
blatant
pedant.
I
was
never
more
disappointed
in
any
man
than
Lanyon.”
“You
know
I
never
approved
of
it,”
pursued
Utterson,
ruthlessly
disregarding
the
fresh
topic.
“My
will?
Yes,
certainly,
I
know
that,”
said
the
doctor,
a
trifle
sharply.
“You
have
told
me
so.”
“Well,
I
tell
you
so
again,”
continued
the
lawyer.
“I
have
been
learning
something
of
young
Hyde.”
The
large
handsome
face
of
Dr.
Jekyll
grew
pale
to
the
very
lips,
and
there
came
a
blackness
about
his
eyes.
“I
do
not
care
to
hear
more,”
said
he.
“This
is
a
matter
I
thought
we
had
agreed
to
drop.”
“What
I
heard
was
abominable,”
said
Utterson.
“It
can
make
no
change.
You
do
not
understand
my
position,”
returned
the

followed
by
several
marks
of
exclamation,
“total
failure!!!”
All
this,
though
it
whetted
my
curiosity,
told
me
little
that
was
definite.
Here
were
a
phial
of
some
salt,
and
the
record
of
a
series
of
experiments
that
had
led
(like
too
many
of
Jekyll’s
investigations)
to
no
end
of
practical
usefulness.
How
could
the
presence
of
these
articles
in
my
house
affect
either
the
honour,
the
sanity,
or
the
life
of
my
flighty
colleague?
If
his
messenger
could
go
to
one
place,
why
could
he
not
go
to
another?
And
even
granting
some
impediment,
why
was
this
gentleman
to
be
received
by
me
in
secret?
The
more
I
reflected
the
more
convinced
I
grew
that
I
was
dealing
with
a
case
of
cerebral
disease;
and
though
I
dismissed
my
servants
to
bed,
I
loaded
an
old
revolver,
that
I
might
be
found
in
some
posture
of
self-defence.
Twelve
o’clock
had
scarce
rung
out
over
London,
ere
the
knocker
sounded
very
gently
on
the
door.
I
went
myself
at
the
summons,
and
found
a
small
man
crouching
against
the
pillars
of
the
portico.
“Are
you
come
from
Dr.
Jekyll?”
I
asked.
He
told
me
“yes”
by
a
constrained
gesture;
and
when
I
had
bidden
him
enter,
he
did
not
obey
me
without
a
searching
backward
glance
into
the
darkness
of
the
square.
There
was
a
policeman
not
far
off,
advancing
with
his
bull’s
eye
open;
and
at
the
sight,
I
thought
my
visitor
started
and
made
greater
haste.
These
particulars

with
flags,
warmed
(after
the
fashion
of
a
country
house)
by
a
bright,
open
fire,
and
furnished
with
costly
cabinets
of
oak.
“Will
you
wait
here
by
the
fire,
sir?
or
shall
I
give
you
a
light
in
the
dining-room?”
“Here,
thank
you,”
said
the
lawyer,
and
he
drew
near
and
leaned
on
the
tall
fender.
This
hall,
in
which
he
was
now
left
alone,
was
a
pet
fancy
of
his
friend
the
doctor’s;
and
Utterson
himself
was
wont
to
speak
of
it
as
the
pleasantest
room
in
London.
But
tonight
there
was
a
shudder
in
his
blood;
the
face
of
Hyde
sat
heavy
on
his
memory;
he
felt
(what
was
rare
with
him)
a
nausea
and
distaste
of
life;
and
in
the
gloom
of
his
spirits,
he
seemed
to
read
a
menace
in
the
flickering
of
the
firelight
on
the
polished
cabinets
and
the
uneasy
starting
of
the
shadow
on
the
roof.
He
was
ashamed
of
his
relief,
when
Poole
presently
returned
to
announce
that
Dr.
Jekyll
was
gone
out.
“I
saw
Mr.
Hyde
go
in
by
the
old
dissecting
room,
Poole,”
he
said.
“Is
that
right,
when
Dr.
Jekyll
is
from
home?”
“Quite
right,
Mr.
Utterson,
sir,”
replied
the
servant.
“Mr.
Hyde
has
a
key.”
“Your
master
seems
to
repose
a
great
deal
of
trust
in
that
young
man,
Poole,”
resumed
the
other
musingly.
“Yes,
sir,
he
does
indeed,”
said
Poole.
“We
have
all
orders
to
obey
him.”
“I
do
not
think
I
ever
met
Mr.
Hyde?”
asked

Mr.
Utterson,
and
tell
me,
is
that
the
doctor’s
foot?”
The
steps
fell
lightly
and
oddly,
with
a
certain
swing,
for
all
they
went
so
slowly;
it
was
different
indeed
from
the
heavy
creaking
tread
of
Henry
Jekyll.
Utterson
sighed.
“Is
there
never
anything
else?”
he
asked.
Poole
nodded.
“Once,”
he
said.
“Once
I
heard
it
weeping!”
“Weeping?
how
that?”
said
the
lawyer,
conscious
of
a
sudden
chill
of
horror.
“Weeping
like
a
woman
or
a
lost
soul,”
said
the
butler.
“I
came
away
with
that
upon
my
heart,
that
I
could
have
wept
too.”
But
now
the
ten
minutes
drew
to
an
end.
Poole
disinterred
the
axe
from
under
a
stack
of
packing
straw;
the
candle
was
set
upon
the
nearest
table
to
light
them
to
the
attack;
and
they
drew
near
with
bated
breath
to
where
that
patient
foot
was
still
going
up
and
down,
up
and
down,
in
the
quiet
of
the
night.
“Jekyll,”
cried
Utterson,
with
a
loud
voice,
“I
demand
to
see
you.”
He
paused
a
moment,
but
there
came
no
reply.
“I
give
you
fair
warning,
our
suspicions
are
aroused,
and
I
must
and
shall
see
you,”
he
resumed;
“if
not
by
fair
means,
then
by
foul--if
not
of
your
consent,
then
by
brute
force!”
“Utterson,”
said
the
voice,
“for
God’s
sake,
have
mercy!”
“Ah,
that’s
not
Jekyll’s
voice--it’s
Hyde’s!”
cried
Utterson.
“Down
with
the
door,
Poole!”
Poole
swung
the
axe
over
his
shoulder;
the
blow
shook
the
building,
and
the
red
baize
door

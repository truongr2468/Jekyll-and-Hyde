night
after
the
funeral,
at
which
he
had
been
sadly
affected,
Utterson
locked
the
door
of
his
business
room,
and
sitting
there
by
the
light
of
a
melancholy
candle,
drew
out
and
set
before
him
an
envelope
addressed
by
the
hand
and
sealed
with
the
seal
of
his
dead
friend.
“PRIVATE:
for
the
hands
of
G.
J.
Utterson
ALONE,
and
in
case
of
his
predecease
to
be
destroyed
unread,”
so
it
was
emphatically
superscribed;
and
the
lawyer
dreaded
to
behold
the
contents.
“I
have
buried
one
friend
to-day,”
he
thought:
“what
if
this
should
cost
me
another?”
And
then
he
condemned
the
fear
as
a
disloyalty,
and
broke
the
seal.
Within
there
was
another
enclosure,
likewise
sealed,
and
marked
upon
the
cover
as
“not
to
be
opened
till
the
death
or
disappearance
of
Dr.
Henry
Jekyll.”
Utterson
could
not
trust
his
eyes.
Yes,
it
was
disappearance;
here
again,
as
in
the
mad
will
which
he
had
long
ago
restored
to
its
author,
here
again
were
the
idea
of
a
disappearance
and
the
name
of
Henry
Jekyll
bracketted.
But
in
the
will,
that
idea
had
sprung
from
the
sinister
suggestion
of
the
man
Hyde;
it
was
set
there
with
a
purpose
all
too
plain
and
horrible.
Written
by
the
hand
of
Lanyon,
what
should
it
mean?
A
great
curiosity
came
on
the
trustee,
to
disregard
the
prohibition
and
dive
at
once
to
the
bottom
of
these
mysteries;
but
professional
honour
and
faith
to
his
dead
friend
were
stringent
obligations;
and
the

The
power
of
the
drug
had
not
been
always
equally
displayed.
Once,
very
early
in
my
career,
it
had
totally
failed
me;
since
then
I
had
been
obliged
on
more
than
one
occasion
to
double,
and
once,
with
infinite
risk
of
death,
to
treble
the
amount;
and
these
rare
uncertainties
had
cast
hitherto
the
sole
shadow
on
my
contentment.
Now,
however,
and
in
the
light
of
that
morning’s
accident,
I
was
led
to
remark
that
whereas,
in
the
beginning,
the
difficulty
had
been
to
throw
off
the
body
of
Jekyll,
it
had
of
late
gradually
but
decidedly
transferred
itself
to
the
other
side.
All
things
therefore
seemed
to
point
to
this;
that
I
was
slowly
losing
hold
of
my
original
and
better
self,
and
becoming
slowly
incorporated
with
my
second
and
worse.
Between
these
two,
I
now
felt
I
had
to
choose.
My
two
natures
had
memory
in
common,
but
all
other
faculties
were
most
unequally
shared
between
them.
Jekyll
(who
was
composite)
now
with
the
most
sensitive
apprehensions,
now
with
a
greedy
gusto,
projected
and
shared
in
the
pleasures
and
adventures
of
Hyde;
but
Hyde
was
indifferent
to
Jekyll,
or
but
remembered
him
as
the
mountain
bandit
remembers
the
cavern
in
which
he
conceals
himself
from
pursuit.
Jekyll
had
more
than
a
father’s
interest;
Hyde
had
more
than
a
son’s
indifference.
To
cast
in
my
lot
with
Jekyll,
was
to
die
to
those
appetites
which
I
had
long
secretly
indulged
and
had
of
late
begun
to
pamper.

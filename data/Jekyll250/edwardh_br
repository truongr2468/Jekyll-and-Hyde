packet
slept
in
the
inmost
corner
of
his
private
safe.
It
is
one
thing
to
mortify
curiosity,
another
to
conquer
it;
and
it
may
be
doubted
if,
from
that
day
forth,
Utterson
desired
the
society
of
his
surviving
friend
with
the
same
eagerness.
He
thought
of
him
kindly;
but
his
thoughts
were
disquieted
and
fearful.
He
went
to
call
indeed;
but
he
was
perhaps
relieved
to
be
denied
admittance;
perhaps,
in
his
heart,
he
preferred
to
speak
with
Poole
upon
the
doorstep
and
surrounded
by
the
air
and
sounds
of
the
open
city,
rather
than
to
be
admitted
into
that
house
of
voluntary
bondage,
and
to
sit
and
speak
with
its
inscrutable
recluse.
Poole
had,
indeed,
no
very
pleasant
news
to
communicate.
The
doctor,
it
appeared,
now
more
than
ever
confined
himself
to
the
cabinet
over
the
laboratory,
where
he
would
sometimes
even
sleep;
he
was
out
of
spirits,
he
had
grown
very
silent,
he
did
not
read;
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
mind.
Utterson
became
so
used
to
the
unvarying
character
of
these
reports,
that
he
fell
off
little
by
little
in
the
frequency
of
his
visits.
INCIDENT
AT
THE
WINDOW
It
chanced
on
Sunday,
when
Mr.
Utterson
was
on
his
usual
walk
with
Mr.
Enfield,
that
their
way
lay
once
again
through
the
by-street;
and
that
when
they
came
in
front
of
the
door,
both
stopped
to
gaze
on
it.
“Well,”
said
Enfield,
“that
story’s
at
an
end
at
least.
We
shall
never
see

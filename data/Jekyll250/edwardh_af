friends
or
any
credit,
we
undertook
that
he
should
lose
them.
And
all
the
time,
as
we
were
pitching
it
in
red
hot,
we
were
keeping
the
women
off
him
as
best
we
could
for
they
were
as
wild
as
harpies.
I
never
saw
a
circle
of
such
hateful
faces;
and
there
was
the
man
in
the
middle,
with
a
kind
of
black
sneering
coolness--frightened
too,
I
could
see
that--but
carrying
it
off,
sir,
really
like
Satan.
`If
you
choose
to
make
capital
out
of
this
accident,’
said
he,
`I
am
naturally
helpless.
No
gentleman
but
wishes
to
avoid
a
scene,’
says
he.
`Name
your
figure.’
Well,
we
screwed
him
up
to
a
hundred
pounds
for
the
child’s
family;
he
would
have
clearly
liked
to
stick
out;
but
there
was
something
about
the
lot
of
us
that
meant
mischief,
and
at
last
he
struck.
The
next
thing
was
to
get
the
money;
and
where
do
you
think
he
carried
us
but
to
that
place
with
the
door?--whipped
out
a
key,
went
in,
and
presently
came
back
with
the
matter
of
ten
pounds
in
gold
and
a
cheque
for
the
balance
on
Coutts’s,
drawn
payable
to
bearer
and
signed
with
a
name
that
I
can’t
mention,
though
it’s
one
of
the
points
of
my
story,
but
it
was
a
name
at
least
very
well
known
and
often
printed.
The
figure
was
stiff;
but
the
signature
was
good
for
more
than
that
if
it
was
only
genuine.
I
took
the
liberty
of

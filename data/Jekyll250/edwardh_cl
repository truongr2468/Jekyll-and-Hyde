in
several
places.
The
lawyer
put
it
in
his
pocket.
“I
would
say
nothing
of
this
paper.
If
your
master
has
fled
or
is
dead,
we
may
at
least
save
his
credit.
It
is
now
ten;
I
must
go
home
and
read
these
documents
in
quiet;
but
I
shall
be
back
before
midnight,
when
we
shall
send
for
the
police.”
They
went
out,
locking
the
door
of
the
theatre
behind
them;
and
Utterson,
once
more
leaving
the
servants
gathered
about
the
fire
in
the
hall,
trudged
back
to
his
office
to
read
the
two
narratives
in
which
this
mystery
was
now
to
be
explained.
DR.
LANYON’S
NARRATIVE
On
the
ninth
of
January,
now
four
days
ago,
I
received
by
the
evening
delivery
a
registered
envelope,
addressed
in
the
hand
of
my
colleague
and
old
school
companion,
Henry
Jekyll.
I
was
a
good
deal
surprised
by
this;
for
we
were
by
no
means
in
the
habit
of
correspondence;
I
had
seen
the
man,
dined
with
him,
indeed,
the
night
before;
and
I
could
imagine
nothing
in
our
intercourse
that
should
justify
formality
of
registration.
The
contents
increased
my
wonder;
for
this
is
how
the
letter
ran:
“10th
December,
18--.
“Dear
Lanyon,--You
are
one
of
my
oldest
friends;
and
although
we
may
have
differed
at
times
on
scientific
questions,
I
cannot
remember,
at
least
on
my
side,
any
break
in
our
affection.
There
was
never
a
day
when,
if
you
had
said
to
me,
`Jekyll,
my
life,
my
honour,
my
reason,
depend

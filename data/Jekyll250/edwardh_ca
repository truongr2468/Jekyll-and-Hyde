old.”
“This
is
a
strange
note,”
said
Mr.
Utterson;
and
then
sharply,
“How
do
you
come
to
have
it
open?”
“The
man
at
Maw’s
was
main
angry,
sir,
and
he
threw
it
back
to
me
like
so
much
dirt,”
returned
Poole.
“This
is
unquestionably
the
doctor’s
hand,
do
you
know?”
resumed
the
lawyer.
“I
thought
it
looked
like
it,”
said
the
servant
rather
sulkily;
and
then,
with
another
voice,
“But
what
matters
hand
of
write?”
he
said.
“I’ve
seen
him!”
“Seen
him?”
repeated
Mr.
Utterson.
“Well?”
“That’s
it!”
said
Poole.
“It
was
this
way.
I
came
suddenly
into
the
theatre
from
the
garden.
It
seems
he
had
slipped
out
to
look
for

it
is;
for
the
cabinet
door
was
open,
and
there
he
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
digging
among
the
crates.
He
looked
up
when
I
came
in,
gave
a
kind
of
cry,
and
whipped
upstairs
into
the
cabinet.
It
was
but
for
one
minute
that
I
saw
him,
but
the
hair
stood
upon
my
head
like
quills.
Sir,
if
that
was
my
master,
why
had
he
a
mask
upon
his
face?
If
it
was
my
master,
why
did
he
cry
out
like
a
rat,
and
run
from
me?
I
have
served
him
long
enough.
And
then...”
The
man
paused
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
face.
“These
are
all
very
strange
circumstances,”
said
Mr.
Utterson,
“but
I
think
I
begin
to
see
daylight.
Your
master,
Poole,
is

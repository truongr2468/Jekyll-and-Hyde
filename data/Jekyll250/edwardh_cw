from
my
eyes,
I
ask
myself
if
I
believe
it,
and
I
cannot
answer.
My
life
is
shaken
to
its
roots;
sleep
has
left
me;
the
deadliest
terror
sits
by
me
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night;
and
I
feel
that
my
days
are
numbered,
and
that
I
must
die;
and
yet
I
shall
die
incredulous.
As
for
the
moral
turpitude
that
man
unveiled
to
me,
even
with
tears
of
penitence,
I
can
not,
even
in
memory,
dwell
on
it
without
a
start
of
horror.
I
will
say
but
one
thing,
Utterson,
and
that
(if
you
can
bring
your
mind
to
credit
it)
will
be
more
than
enough.
The
creature
who
crept
into
my
house
that
night
was,
on
Jekyll’s
own
confession,
known
by
the
name
of
Hyde
and
hunted
for
in
every
corner
of
the
land
as
the
murderer
of
Carew.
HASTIE
LANYON
HENRY
JEKYLL’S
FULL
STATEMENT
OF
THE
CASE
I
was
born
in
the
year
18--
to
a
large
fortune,
endowed
besides
with
excellent
parts,
inclined
by
nature
to
industry,
fond
of
the
respect
of
the
wise
and
good
among
my
fellowmen,
and
thus,
as
might
have
been
supposed,
with
every
guarantee
of
an
honourable
and
distinguished
future.
And
indeed
the
worst
of
my
faults
was
a
certain
impatient
gaiety
of
disposition,
such
as
has
made
the
happiness
of
many,
but
such
as
I
found
it
hard
to
reconcile
with
my
imperious
desire
to
carry
my
head
high,
and
wear
a
more
than
commonly
grave
countenance

might
have
succumbed,
Hyde
rose
to
the
importance
of
the
moment.
My
drugs
were
in
one
of
the
presses
of
my
cabinet;
how
was
I
to
reach
them?
That
was
the
problem
that
(crushing
my
temples
in
my
hands)
I
set
myself
to
solve.
The
laboratory
door
I
had
closed.
If
I
sought
to
enter
by
the
house,
my
own
servants
would
consign
me
to
the
gallows.
I
saw
I
must
employ
another
hand,
and
thought
of
Lanyon.
How
was
he
to
be
reached?
how
persuaded?
Supposing
that
I
escaped
capture
in
the
streets,
how
was
I
to
make
my
way
into
his
presence?
and
how
should
I,
an
unknown
and
displeasing
visitor,
prevail
on
the
famous
physician
to
rifle
the
study
of
his
colleague,
Dr.
Jekyll?
Then
I
remembered
that
of
my
original
character,
one
part
remained
to
me:
I
could
write
my
own
hand;
and
once
I
had
conceived
that
kindling
spark,
the
way
that
I
must
follow
became
lighted
up
from
end
to
end.
Thereupon,
I
arranged
my
clothes
as
best
I
could,
and
summoning
a
passing
hansom,
drove
to
an
hotel
in
Portland
Street,
the
name
of
which
I
chanced
to
remember.
At
my
appearance
(which
was
indeed
comical
enough,
however
tragic
a
fate
these
garments
covered)
the
driver
could
not
conceal
his
mirth.
I
gnashed
my
teeth
upon
him
with
a
gust
of
devilish
fury;
and
the
smile
withered
from
his
face--happily
for
him--yet
more
happily
for
myself,
for
in
another
instant
I
had

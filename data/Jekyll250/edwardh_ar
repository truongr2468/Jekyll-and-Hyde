Mr.
Hyde,
“It
is
as
well
we
have
met;
and
apropos,
you
should
have
my
address.”
And
he
gave
a
number
of
a
street
in
Soho.
“Good
God!”
thought
Mr.
Utterson,
“can
he,
too,
have
been
thinking
of
the
will?”
But
he
kept
his
feelings
to
himself
and
only
grunted
in
acknowledgment
of
the
address.
“And
now,”
said
the
other,
“how
did
you
know
me?”
“By
description,”
was
the
reply.
“Whose
description?”
“We
have
common
friends,”
said
Mr.
Utterson.
“Common
friends,”
echoed
Mr.
Hyde,
a
little
hoarsely.
“Who
are
they?”
“Jekyll,
for
instance,”
said
the
lawyer.
“He
never
told
you,”
cried
Mr.
Hyde,
with
a
flush
of
anger.
“I
did
not
think
you
would
have
lied.”
“Come,”
said
Mr.
Utterson,
“that
is
not
fitting
language.”
The
other
snarled
aloud
into
a
savage
laugh;
and
the
next
moment,
with
extraordinary
quickness,
he
had
unlocked
the
door
and
disappeared
into
the
house.
The
lawyer
stood
awhile
when
Mr.
Hyde
had
left
him,
the
picture
of
disquietude.
Then
he
began
slowly
to
mount
the
street,
pausing
every
step
or
two
and
putting
his
hand
to
his
brow
like
a
man
in
mental
perplexity.
The
problem
he
was
thus
debating
as
he
walked,
was
one
of
a
class
that
is
rarely
solved.
Mr.
Hyde
was
pale
and
dwarfish,
he
gave
an
impression
of
deformity
without
any
nameable
malformation,
he
had
a
displeasing
smile,
he
had
borne
himself
to
the
lawyer
with
a
sort
of
murderous
mixture
of
timidity
and
boldness,
and
he
spoke
with

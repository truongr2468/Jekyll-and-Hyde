began
Enfield,
surprised
out
of
himself.
“Yes,
I
know,”
said
Utterson;
“I
know
it
must
seem
strange.
The
fact
is,
if
I
do
not
ask
you
the
name
of
the
other
party,
it
is
because
I
know
it
already.
You
see,
Richard,
your
tale
has
gone
home.
If
you
have
been
inexact
in
any
point
you
had
better
correct
it.”
“I
think
you
might
have
warned
me,”
returned
the
other
with
a
touch
of
sullenness.
“But
I
have
been
pedantically
exact,
as
you
call
it.
The
fellow
had
a
key;
and
what’s
more,
he
has
it
still.
I
saw
him
use
it
not
a
week
ago.”
Mr.
Utterson
sighed
deeply
but
said
never
a
word;
and
the
young
man
presently
resumed.
“Here
is
another
lesson
to
say
nothing,”
said
he.
“I
am
ashamed
of
my
long
tongue.
Let
us
make
a
bargain
never
to
refer
to
this
again.”
“With
all
my
heart,”
said
the
lawyer.
“I
shake
hands
on
that,
Richard.”
SEARCH
FOR
MR.
HYDE
That
evening
Mr.
Utterson
came
home
to
his
bachelor
house
in
sombre
spirits
and
sat
down
to
dinner
without
relish.
It
was
his
custom
of
a
Sunday,
when
this
meal
was
over,
to
sit
close
by
the
fire,
a
volume
of
some
dry
divinity
on
his
reading
desk,
until
the
clock
of
the
neighbouring
church
rang
out
the
hour
of
twelve,
when
he
would
go
soberly
and
gratefully
to
bed.
On
this
night
however,
as
soon
as
the
cloth
was
taken
away,
he
took
up

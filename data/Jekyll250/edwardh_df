house
in
the
square;
and
to
parry
mishaps,
I
even
called
and
made
myself
a
familiar
object,
in
my
second
character.
I
next
drew
up
that
will
to
which
you
so
much
objected;
so
that
if
anything
befell
me
in
the
person
of
Dr.
Jekyll,
I
could
enter
on
that
of
Edward
Hyde
without
pecuniary
loss.
And
thus
fortified,
as
I
supposed,
on
every
side,
I
began
to
profit
by
the
strange
immunities
of
my
position.
Men
have
before
hired
bravos
to
transact
their
crimes,
while
their
own
person
and
reputation
sat
under
shelter.
I
was
the
first
that
ever
did
so
for
his
pleasures.
I
was
the
first
that
could
plod
in
the
public
eye
with
a
load
of
genial
respectability,
and
in
a
moment,
like
a
schoolboy,
strip
off
these
lendings
and
spring
headlong
into
the
sea
of
liberty.
But
for
me,
in
my
impenetrable
mantle,
the
safety
was
complete.
Think
of
it--I
did
not
even
exist!
Let
me
but
escape
into
my
laboratory
door,
give
me
but
a
second
or
two
to
mix
and
swallow
the
draught
that
I
had
always
standing
ready;
and
whatever
he
had
done,
Edward
Hyde
would
pass
away
like
the
stain
of
breath
upon
a
mirror;
and
there
in
his
stead,
quietly
at
home,
trimming
the
midnight
lamp
in
his
study,
a
man
who
could
afford
to
laugh
at
suspicion,
would
be
Henry
Jekyll.
The
pleasures
which
I
made
haste
to
seek
in
my
disguise
were,
as
I
have
said,
undignified;
I

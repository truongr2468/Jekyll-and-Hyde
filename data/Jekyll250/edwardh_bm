all
disreputable:
tales
came
out
of
the
man’s
cruelty,
at
once
so
callous
and
violent;
of
his
vile
life,
of
his
strange
associates,
of
the
hatred
that
seemed
to
have
surrounded
his
career;
but
of
his
present
whereabouts,
not
a
whisper.
From
the
time
he
had
left
the
house
in
Soho
on
the
morning
of
the
murder,
he
was
simply
blotted
out;
and
gradually,
as
time
drew
on,
Mr.
Utterson
began
to
recover
from
the
hotness
of
his
alarm,
and
to
grow
more
at
quiet
with
himself.
The
death
of
Sir
Danvers
was,
to
his
way
of
thinking,
more
than
paid
for
by
the
disappearance
of
Mr.
Hyde.
Now
that
that
evil
influence
had
been
withdrawn,
a
new
life
began
for
Dr.
Jekyll.
He
came
out
of
his
seclusion,
renewed
relations
with
his
friends,
became
once
more
their
familiar
guest
and
entertainer;
and
whilst
he
had
always
been
known
for
charities,
he
was
now
no
less
distinguished
for
religion.
He
was
busy,
he
was
much
in
the
open
air,
he
did
good;
his
face
seemed
to
open
and
brighten,
as
if
with
an
inward
consciousness
of
service;
and
for
more
than
two
months,
the
doctor
was
at
peace.
On
the
8th
of
January
Utterson
had
dined
at
the
doctor’s
with
a
small
party;
Lanyon
had
been
there;
and
the
face
of
the
host
had
looked
from
one
to
the
other
as
in
the
old
days
when
the
trio
were
inseparable
friends.
On
the
12th,
and
again
on
the
14th,
the

pointing
out
to
my
gentleman
that
the
whole
business
looked
apocryphal,
and
that
a
man
does
not,
in
real
life,
walk
into
a
cellar
door
at
four
in
the
morning
and
come
out
with
another
man’s
cheque
for
close
upon
a
hundred
pounds.
But
he
was
quite
easy
and
sneering.
`Set
your
mind
at
rest,’
says
he,
`I
will
stay
with
you
till
the
banks
open
and
cash
the
cheque
myself.’
So
we
all
set
off,
the
doctor,
and
the
child’s
father,
and
our
friend
and
myself,
and
passed
the
rest
of
the
night
in
my
chambers;
and
next
day,
when
we
had
breakfasted,
went
in
a
body
to
the
bank.
I
gave
in
the
cheque
myself,
and
said
I
had
every
reason
to
believe
it
was
a
forgery.
Not
a
bit
of
it.
The
cheque
was
genuine.”
“Tut-tut,”
said
Mr.
Utterson.
“I
see
you
feel
as
I
do,”
said
Mr.
Enfield.
“Yes,
it’s
a
bad
story.
For
my
man
was
a
fellow
that
nobody
could
have
to
do
with,
a
really
damnable
man;
and
the
person
that
drew
the
cheque
is
the
very
pink
of
the
proprieties,
celebrated
too,
and
(what
makes
it
worse)
one
of
your
fellows
who
do
what
they
call
good.
Black
mail
I
suppose;
an
honest
man
paying
through
the
nose
for
some
of
the
capers
of
his
youth.
Black
Mail
House
is
what
I
call
the
place
with
the
door,
in
consequence.
Though
even
that,
you
know,
is
far
from
explaining
all,”
he
added,

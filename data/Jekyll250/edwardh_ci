locked;
and
lying
near
by
on
the
flags,
they
found
the
key,
already
stained
with
rust.
“This
does
not
look
like
use,”
observed
the
lawyer.
“Use!”
echoed
Poole.
“Do
you
not
see,
sir,
it
is
broken?
much
as
if
a
man
had
stamped
on
it.”
“Ay,”
continued
Utterson,
“and
the
fractures,
too,
are
rusty.”
The
two
men
looked
at
each
other
with
a
scare.
“This
is
beyond
me,
Poole,”
said
the
lawyer.
“Let
us
go
back
to
the
cabinet.”
They
mounted
the
stair
in
silence,
and
still
with
an
occasional
awestruck
glance
at
the
dead
body,
proceeded
more
thoroughly
to
examine
the
contents
of
the
cabinet.
At
one
table,
there
were
traces
of
chemical
work,
various
measured
heaps
of
some
white
salt
being
laid
on
glass
saucers,
as
though
for
an
experiment
in
which
the
unhappy
man
had
been
prevented.
“That
is
the
same
drug
that
I
was
always
bringing
him,”
said
Poole;
and
even
as
he
spoke,
the
kettle
with
a
startling
noise
boiled
over.
This
brought
them
to
the
fireside,
where
the
easy-chair
was
drawn
cosily
up,
and
the
tea
things
stood
ready
to
the
sitter’s
elbow,
the
very
sugar
in
the
cup.
There
were
several
books
on
a
shelf;
one
lay
beside
the
tea
things
open,
and
Utterson
was
amazed
to
find
it
a
copy
of
a
pious
work,
for
which
Jekyll
had
several
times
expressed
a
great
esteem,
annotated,
in
his
own
hand
with
startling
blasphemies.
Next,
in
the
course
of
their
review
of
the
chamber,

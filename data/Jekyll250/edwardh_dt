him
like
a
tempest.
He
walked
fast,
hunted
by
his
fears,
chattering
to
himself,
skulking
through
the
less
frequented
thoroughfares,
counting
the
minutes
that
still
divided
him
from
midnight.
Once
a
woman
spoke
to
him,
offering,
I
think,
a
box
of
lights.
He
smote
her
in
the
face,
and
she
fled.
When
I
came
to
myself
at
Lanyon’s,
the
horror
of
my
old
friend
perhaps
affected
me
somewhat:
I
do
not
know;
it
was
at
least
but
a
drop
in
the
sea
to
the
abhorrence
with
which
I
looked
back
upon
these
hours.
A
change
had
come
over
me.
It
was
no
longer
the
fear
of
the
gallows,
it
was
the
horror
of
being
Hyde
that
racked
me.
I
received
Lanyon’s
condemnation
partly
in
a
dream;
it
was
partly
in
a
dream
that
I
came
home
to
my
own
house
and
got
into
bed.
I
slept
after
the
prostration
of
the
day,
with
a
stringent
and
profound
slumber
which
not
even
the
nightmares
that
wrung
me
could
avail
to
break.
I
awoke
in
the
morning
shaken,
weakened,
but
refreshed.
I
still
hated
and
feared
the
thought
of
the
brute
that
slept
within
me,
and
I
had
not
of
course
forgotten
the
appalling
dangers
of
the
day
before;
but
I
was
once
more
at
home,
in
my
own
house
and
close
to
my
drugs;
and
gratitude
for
my
escape
shone
so
strong
in
my
soul
that
it
almost
rivalled
the
brightness
of
hope.
I
was
stepping
leisurely
across
the
court
after

paper
and
throw
it
on
the
stair.
We’ve
had
nothing
else
this
week
back;
nothing
but
papers,
and
a
closed
door,
and
the
very
meals
left
there
to
be
smuggled
in
when
nobody
was
looking.
Well,
sir,
every
day,
ay,
and
twice
and
thrice
in
the
same
day,
there
have
been
orders
and
complaints,
and
I
have
been
sent
flying
to
all
the
wholesale
chemists
in
town.
Every
time
I
brought
the
stuff
back,
there
would
be
another
paper
telling
me
to
return
it,
because
it
was
not
pure,
and
another
order
to
a
different
firm.
This
drug
is
wanted
bitter
bad,
sir,
whatever
for.”
“Have
you
any
of
these
papers?”
asked
Mr.
Utterson.
Poole
felt
in
his
pocket
and
handed
out
a
crumpled
note,
which
the
lawyer,
bending
nearer
to
the
candle,
carefully
examined.
Its
contents
ran
thus:
“Dr.
Jekyll
presents
his
compliments
to
Messrs.
Maw.
He
assures
them
that
their
last
sample
is
impure
and
quite
useless
for
his
present
purpose.
In
the
year
18--,
Dr.
J.
purchased
a
somewhat
large
quantity
from
Messrs.
M.
He
now
begs
them
to
search
with
most
sedulous
care,
and
should
any
of
the
same
quality
be
left,
forward
it
to
him
at
once.
Expense
is
no
consideration.
The
importance
of
this
to
Dr.
J.
can
hardly
be
exaggerated.”
So
far
the
letter
had
run
composedly
enough,
but
here
with
a
sudden
splutter
of
the
pen,
the
writer’s
emotion
had
broken
loose.
“For
God’s
sake,”
he
added,
“find
me
some

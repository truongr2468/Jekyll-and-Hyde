comfortable
morning
doze.
I
was
still
so
engaged
when,
in
one
of
my
more
wakeful
moments,
my
eyes
fell
upon
my
hand.
Now
the
hand
of
Henry
Jekyll
(as
you
have
often
remarked)
was
professional
in
shape
and
size:
it
was
large,
firm,
white
and
comely.
But
the
hand
which
I
now
saw,
clearly
enough,
in
the
yellow
light
of
a
mid-London
morning,
lying
half
shut
on
the
bedclothes,
was
lean,
corder,
knuckly,
of
a
dusky
pallor
and
thickly
shaded
with
a
swart
growth
of
hair.
It
was
the
hand
of
Edward
Hyde.
I
must
have
stared
upon
it
for
near
half
a
minute,
sunk
as
I
was
in
the
mere
stupidity
of
wonder,
before
terror
woke
up
in
my
breast
as
sudden
and
startling
as
the
crash
of
cymbals;
and
bounding
from
my
bed
I
rushed
to
the
mirror.
At
the
sight
that
met
my
eyes,
my
blood
was
changed
into
something
exquisitely
thin
and
icy.
Yes,
I
had
gone
to
bed
Henry
Jekyll,
I
had
awakened
Edward
Hyde.
How
was
this
to
be
explained?
I
asked
myself;
and
then,
with
another
bound
of
terror--how
was
it
to
be
remedied?
It
was
well
on
in
the
morning;
the
servants
were
up;
all
my
drugs
were
in
the
cabinet--a
long
journey
down
two
pairs
of
stairs,
through
the
back
passage,
across
the
open
court
and
through
the
anatomical
theatre,
from
where
I
was
then
standing
horror-struck.
It
might
indeed
be
possible
to
cover
my
face;
but
of
what
use
was

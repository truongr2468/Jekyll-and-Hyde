if
that
were
so,
it
must
be
differently
judged,
and
handled
with
the
more
caution.
The
newsboys,
as
he
went,
were
crying
themselves
hoarse
along
the
footways:
“Special
edition.
Shocking
murder
of
an
M.P.”
That
was
the
funeral
oration
of
one
friend
and
client;
and
he
could
not
help
a
certain
apprehension
lest
the
good
name
of
another
should
be
sucked
down
in
the
eddy
of
the
scandal.
It
was,
at
least,
a
ticklish
decision
that
he
had
to
make;
and
self-reliant
as
he
was
by
habit,
he
began
to
cherish
a
longing
for
advice.
It
was
not
to
be
had
directly;
but
perhaps,
he
thought,
it
might
be
fished
for.
Presently
after,
he
sat
on
one
side
of
his
own
hearth,
with
Mr.
Guest,
his
head
clerk,
upon
the
other,
and
midway
between,
at
a
nicely
calculated
distance
from
the
fire,
a
bottle
of
a
particular
old
wine
that
had
long
dwelt
unsunned
in
the
foundations
of
his
house.
The
fog
still
slept
on
the
wing
above
the
drowned
city,
where
the
lamps
glimmered
like
carbuncles;
and
through
the
muffle
and
smother
of
these
fallen
clouds,
the
procession
of
the
town’s
life
was
still
rolling
in
through
the
great
arteries
with
a
sound
as
of
a
mighty
wind.
But
the
room
was
gay
with
firelight.
In
the
bottle
the
acids
were
long
ago
resolved;
the
imperial
dye
had
softened
with
time,
as
the
colour
grows
richer
in
stained
windows;
and
the
glow
of
hot
autumn
afternoons
on
hillside
vineyards,

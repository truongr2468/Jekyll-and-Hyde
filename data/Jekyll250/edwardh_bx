indeed,
when
the
girl
had
so
suddenly
raised
the
note
of
her
lamentation,
they
had
all
started
and
turned
towards
the
inner
door
with
faces
of
dreadful
expectation.
“And
now,”
continued
the
butler,
addressing
the
knife-boy,
“reach
me
a
candle,
and
we’ll
get
this
through
hands
at
once.”
And
then
he
begged
Mr.
Utterson
to
follow
him,
and
led
the
way
to
the
back
garden.
“Now,
sir,”
said
he,
“you
come
as
gently
as
you
can.
I
want
you
to
hear,
and
I
don’t
want
you
to
be
heard.
And
see
here,
sir,
if
by
any
chance
he
was
to
ask
you
in,
don’t
go.”
Mr.
Utterson’s
nerves,
at
this
unlooked-for
termination,
gave
a
jerk
that
nearly
threw
him
from
his
balance;
but
he
recollected
his
courage
and
followed
the
butler
into
the
laboratory
building
through
the
surgical
theatre,
with
its
lumber
of
crates
and
bottles,
to
the
foot
of
the
stair.
Here
Poole
motioned
him
to
stand
on
one
side
and
listen;
while
he
himself,
setting
down
the
candle
and
making
a
great
and
obvious
call
on
his
resolution,
mounted
the
steps
and
knocked
with
a
somewhat
uncertain
hand
on
the
red
baize
of
the
cabinet
door.
“Mr.
Utterson,
sir,
asking
to
see
you,”
he
called;
and
even
as
he
did
so,
once
more
violently
signed
to
the
lawyer
to
give
ear.
A
voice
answered
from
within:
“Tell
him
I
cannot
see
anyone,”
it
said
complainingly.
“Thank
you,
sir,”
said
Poole,
with
a
note
of
something
like
triumph
in

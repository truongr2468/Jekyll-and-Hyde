and
out
of
the
shifting,
insubstantial
mists
that
had
so
long
baffled
his
eye,
there
leaped
up
the
sudden,
definite
presentment
of
a
fiend.
“I
thought
it
was
madness,”
he
said,
as
he
replaced
the
obnoxious
paper
in
the
safe,
“and
now
I
begin
to
fear
it
is
disgrace.”
With
that
he
blew
out
his
candle,
put
on
a
greatcoat,
and
set
forth
in
the
direction
of
Cavendish
Square,
that
citadel
of
medicine,
where
his
friend,
the
great
Dr.
Lanyon,
had
his
house
and
received
his
crowding
patients.
“If
anyone
knows,
it
will
be
Lanyon,”
he
had
thought.
The
solemn
butler
knew
and
welcomed
him;
he
was
subjected
to
no
stage
of
delay,
but
ushered
direct
from
the
door
to
the
dining-room
where
Dr.
Lanyon
sat
alone
over
his
wine.
This
was
a
hearty,
healthy,
dapper,
red-faced
gentleman,
with
a
shock
of
hair
prematurely
white,
and
a
boisterous
and
decided
manner.
At
sight
of
Mr.
Utterson,
he
sprang
up
from
his
chair
and
welcomed
him
with
both
hands.
The
geniality,
as
was
the
way
of
the
man,
was
somewhat
theatrical
to
the
eye;
but
it
reposed
on
genuine
feeling.
For
these
two
were
old
friends,
old
mates
both
at
school
and
college,
both
thorough
respectors
of
themselves
and
of
each
other,
and
what
does
not
always
follow,
men
who
thoroughly
enjoyed
each
other’s
company.
After
a
little
rambling
talk,
the
lawyer
led
up
to
the
subject
which
so
disagreeably
preoccupied
his
mind.
“I
suppose,
Lanyon,”
said
he,
“you
and
I

would
scarce
use
a
harder
term.
But
in
the
hands
of
Edward
Hyde,
they
soon
began
to
turn
toward
the
monstrous.
When
I
would
come
back
from
these
excursions,
I
was
often
plunged
into
a
kind
of
wonder
at
my
vicarious
depravity.
This
familiar
that
I
called
out
of
my
own
soul,
and
sent
forth
alone
to
do
his
good
pleasure,
was
a
being
inherently
malign
and
villainous;
his
every
act
and
thought
centered
on
self;
drinking
pleasure
with
bestial
avidity
from
any
degree
of
torture
to
another;
relentless
like
a
man
of
stone.
Henry
Jekyll
stood
at
times
aghast
before
the
acts
of
Edward
Hyde;
but
the
situation
was
apart
from
ordinary
laws,
and
insidiously
relaxed
the
grasp
of
conscience.
It
was
Hyde,
after
all,
and
Hyde
alone,
that
was
guilty.
Jekyll
was
no
worse;
he
woke
again
to
his
good
qualities
seemingly
unimpaired;
he
would
even
make
haste,
where
it
was
possible,
to
undo
the
evil
done
by
Hyde.
And
thus
his
conscience
slumbered.
Into
the
details
of
the
infamy
at
which
I
thus
connived
(for
even
now
I
can
scarce
grant
that
I
committed
it)
I
have
no
design
of
entering;
I
mean
but
to
point
out
the
warnings
and
the
successive
steps
with
which
my
chastisement
approached.
I
met
with
one
accident
which,
as
it
brought
on
no
consequence,
I
shall
no
more
than
mention.
An
act
of
cruelty
to
a
child
aroused
against
me
the
anger
of
a
passer-by,
whom
I
recognised
the
other
day
in
the
person
of
your
kinsman;
the
doctor
and
the
childâ€™s
family
joined
him;
there
were
moments
when
I
feared
for
my
life;
and
at
last,
in
order
to
pacify
their
too
just
resentment,
Edward
Hyde
had
to
bring
them
to
the
door,
and
pay
them
in
a
cheque
drawn
in
the
name
of
Henry
Jekyll.
But
this
danger
was
easily
eliminated
from
the
future,
by
opening
an
account
at
another
bank
in
the
name
of
Edward
Hyde
himself;
and
when,
by
sloping
my
own
hand
backward,
I
had
supplied
my
double
with
a
signature,
I
thought
I
sat
beyond
the
reach
of
fate.
Some
two
months
before
the
murder
of
Sir
Danvers,
I
had
been
out
for
one
of
my
adventures,
had
returned
at
a
late
hour,
and
woke
the
next
day
in
bed
with
somewhat
odd
sensations.
It
was
in
vain
I
looked
about
me;
in
vain
I
saw
the
decent
furniture
and
tall
proportions
of
my
room
in
the
square;
in
vain
that
I
recognised
the
pattern
of
the
bed
curtains
and
the
design
of
the
mahogany
frame;
something
still
kept
insisting
that
I
was
not
where
I
was,
that
I
had
not
wakened
where
I
seemed
to
be,
but
in
the
little
room
in
Soho
where
I
was
accustomed
to
sleep
in
the
body
of
Edward
Hyde.
I
smiled
to
myself,
and
in
my
psychological
way,
began
lazily
to
inquire
into
the
elements
of
this
illusion,
occasionally,
even
as
I
did
so,
dropping
back
into
a

a
candle
and
went
into
his
business
room.
There
he
opened
his
safe,
took
from
the
most
private
part
of
it
a
document
endorsed
on
the
envelope
as
Dr.
Jekyll’s
Will
and
sat
down
with
a
clouded
brow
to
study
its
contents.
The
will
was
holograph,
for
Mr.
Utterson
though
he
took
charge
of
it
now
that
it
was
made,
had
refused
to
lend
the
least
assistance
in
the
making
of
it;
it
provided
not
only
that,
in
case
of
the
decease
of
Henry
Jekyll,
M.D.,
D.C.L.,
L.L.D.,
F.R.S.,
etc.,
all
his
possessions
were
to
pass
into
the
hands
of
his
“friend
and
benefactor
Edward
Hyde,”
but
that
in
case
of
Dr.
Jekyll’s
“disappearance
or
unexplained
absence
for
any
period
exceeding
three
calendar
months,”
the
said
Edward
Hyde
should
step
into
the
said
Henry
Jekyll’s
shoes
without
further
delay
and
free
from
any
burthen
or
obligation
beyond
the
payment
of
a
few
small
sums
to
the
members
of
the
doctor’s
household.
This
document
had
long
been
the
lawyer’s
eyesore.
It
offended
him
both
as
a
lawyer
and
as
a
lover
of
the
sane
and
customary
sides
of
life,
to
whom
the
fanciful
was
the
immodest.
And
hitherto
it
was
his
ignorance
of
Mr.
Hyde
that
had
swelled
his
indignation;
now,
by
a
sudden
turn,
it
was
his
knowledge.
It
was
already
bad
enough
when
the
name
was
but
a
name
of
which
he
could
learn
no
more.
It
was
worse
when
it
began
to
be
clothed
upon
with
detestable
attributes;
and
out
of
the
shifting,
insubstantial
mists
that
had
so
long
baffled
his
eye,
there
leaped
up
the
sudden,
definite
presentment
of
a
fiend.
“I
thought
it
was
madness,”
he
said,
as
he
replaced
the
obnoxious
paper
in
the
safe,
“and
now
I
begin
to
fear
it
is
disgrace.”
With
that
he
blew
out
his
candle,
put
on
a
greatcoat,
and
set
forth
in
the
direction
of
Cavendish
Square,
that
citadel
of
medicine,
where
his
friend,
the
great
Dr.
Lanyon,
had
his
house
and
received
his
crowding
patients.
“If
anyone
knows,
it
will
be
Lanyon,”
he
had
thought.
The
solemn
butler
knew
and
welcomed
him;
he
was
subjected
to
no
stage
of
delay,
but
ushered
direct
from
the
door
to
the
dining-room
where
Dr.
Lanyon
sat
alone
over
his
wine.
This
was
a
hearty,
healthy,
dapper,
red-faced
gentleman,
with
a
shock
of
hair
prematurely
white,
and
a
boisterous
and
decided
manner.
At
sight
of
Mr.
Utterson,
he
sprang
up
from
his
chair
and
welcomed
him
with
both
hands.
The
geniality,
as
was
the
way
of
the
man,
was
somewhat
theatrical
to
the
eye;
but
it
reposed
on
genuine
feeling.
For
these
two
were
old
friends,
old
mates
both
at
school
and
college,
both
thorough
respectors
of
themselves
and
of
each
other,
and
what
does
not
always
follow,
men
who
thoroughly
enjoyed
each
other’s
company.
After
a
little
rambling
talk,
the
lawyer
led
up
to
the
subject
which
so
disagreeably
preoccupied
his
mind.
“I
suppose,
Lanyon,”
said
he,
“you
and
I

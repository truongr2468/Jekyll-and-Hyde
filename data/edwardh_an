sudden
he
broke
out
in
a
great
flame
of
anger,
stamping
with
his
foot,
brandishing
the
cane,
and
carrying
on
(as
the
maid
described
it)
like
a
madman.
The
old
gentleman
took
a
step
back,
with
the
air
of
one
very
much
surprised
and
a
trifle
hurt;
and
at
that
Mr.
Hyde
broke
out
of
all
bounds
and
clubbed
him
to
the
earth.
And
next
moment,
with
ape-like
fury,
he
was
trampling
his
victim
under
foot
and
hailing
down
a
storm
of
blows,
under
which
the
bones
were
audibly
shattered
and
the
body
jumped
upon
the
roadway.
At
the
horror
of
these
sights
and
sounds,
the
maid
fainted.
It
was
two
o’clock
when
she
came
to
herself
and
called
for
the
police.
The
murderer
was
gone
long
ago;
but
there
lay
his
victim
in
the
middle
of
the
lane,
incredibly
mangled.
The
stick
with
which
the
deed
had
been
done,
although
it
was
of
some
rare
and
very
tough
and
heavy
wood,
had
broken
in
the
middle
under
the
stress
of
this
insensate
cruelty;
and
one
splintered
half
had
rolled
in
the
neighbouring
gutter--the
other,
without
doubt,
had
been
carried
away
by
the
murderer.
A
purse
and
gold
watch
were
found
upon
the
victim:
but
no
cards
or
papers,
except
a
sealed
and
stamped
envelope,
which
he
had
been
probably
carrying
to
the
post,
and
which
bore
the
name
and
address
of
Mr.
Utterson.
This
was
brought
to
the
lawyer
the
next
morning,
before
he
was
out
of
bed;
and
he
had
no
sooner
seen
it
and
been
told
the
circumstances,
than
he
shot
out
a
solemn
lip.
“I
shall
say
nothing
till
I
have
seen
the
body,”
said
he;
“this
may
be
very
serious.
Have
the
kindness
to
wait
while
I
dress.”
And
with
the
same
grave
countenance
he
hurried
through
his
breakfast
and
drove
to
the
police
station,
whither
the
body
had
been
carried.
As
soon
as
he
came
into
the
cell,
he
nodded.
“Yes,”
said
he,
“I
recognise
him.
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
this
is
Sir
Danvers
Carew.”
“Good
God,
sir,”
exclaimed
the
officer,
“is
it
possible?”
And
the
next
moment
his
eye
lighted
up
with
professional
ambition.
“This
will
make
a
deal
of
noise,”
he
said.
“And
perhaps
you
can
help
us
to
the
man.”
And
he
briefly
narrated
what
the
maid
had
seen,
and
showed
the
broken
stick.
Mr.
Utterson
had
already
quailed
at
the
name
of
Hyde;
but
when
the
stick
was
laid
before
him,
he
could
doubt
no
longer;
broken
and
battered
as
it
was,
he
recognized
it
for
one
that
he
had
himself
presented
many
years
before
to
Henry
Jekyll.
“Is
this
Mr.
Hyde
a
person
of
small
stature?”
he
inquired.
“Particularly
small
and
particularly
wicked-looking,
is
what
the
maid
calls
him,”
said
the
officer.
Mr.
Utterson
reflected;
and
then,
raising
his
head,
“If
you
will
come
with
me
in
my
cab,”
he
said,
“I
think
I
can
take
you
to
his
house.”
It
was
by
this
time
about
nine

all
disreputable:
tales
came
out
of
the
man’s
cruelty,
at
once
so
callous
and
violent;
of
his
vile
life,
of
his
strange
associates,
of
the
hatred
that
seemed
to
have
surrounded
his
career;
but
of
his
present
whereabouts,
not
a
whisper.
From
the
time
he
had
left
the
house
in
Soho
on
the
morning
of
the
murder,
he
was
simply
blotted
out;
and
gradually,
as
time
drew
on,
Mr.
Utterson
began
to
recover
from
the
hotness
of
his
alarm,
and
to
grow
more
at
quiet
with
himself.
The
death
of
Sir
Danvers
was,
to
his
way
of
thinking,
more
than
paid
for
by
the
disappearance
of
Mr.
Hyde.
Now
that
that
evil
influence
had
been
withdrawn,
a
new
life
began
for
Dr.
Jekyll.
He
came
out
of
his
seclusion,
renewed
relations
with
his
friends,
became
once
more
their
familiar
guest
and
entertainer;
and
whilst
he
had
always
been
known
for
charities,
he
was
now
no
less
distinguished
for
religion.
He
was
busy,
he
was
much
in
the
open
air,
he
did
good;
his
face
seemed
to
open
and
brighten,
as
if
with
an
inward
consciousness
of
service;
and
for
more
than
two
months,
the
doctor
was
at
peace.
On
the
8th
of
January
Utterson
had
dined
at
the
doctor’s
with
a
small
party;
Lanyon
had
been
there;
and
the
face
of
the
host
had
looked
from
one
to
the
other
as
in
the
old
days
when
the
trio
were
inseparable
friends.
On
the
12th,
and
again
on
the
14th,
the
door
was
shut
against
the
lawyer.
“The
doctor
was
confined
to
the
house,”
Poole
said,
“and
saw
no
one.”
On
the
15th,
he
tried
again,
and
was
again
refused;
and
having
now
been
used
for
the
last
two
months
to
see
his
friend
almost
daily,
he
found
this
return
of
solitude
to
weigh
upon
his
spirits.
The
fifth
night
he
had
in
Guest
to
dine
with
him;
and
the
sixth
he
betook
himself
to
Dr.
Lanyon’s.
There
at
least
he
was
not
denied
admittance;
but
when
he
came
in,
he
was
shocked
at
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
the
doctor’s
appearance.
He
had
his
death-warrant
written
legibly
upon
his
face.
The
rosy
man
had
grown
pale;
his
flesh
had
fallen
away;
he
was
visibly
balder
and
older;
and
yet
it
was
not
so
much
these
tokens
of
a
swift
physical
decay
that
arrested
the
lawyer’s
notice,
as
a
look
in
the
eye
and
quality
of
manner
that
seemed
to
testify
to
some
deep-seated
terror
of
the
mind.
It
was
unlikely
that
the
doctor
should
fear
death;
and
yet
that
was
what
Utterson
was
tempted
to
suspect.
“Yes,”
he
thought;
“he
is
a
doctor,
he
must
know
his
own
state
and
that
his
days
are
counted;
and
the
knowledge
is
more
than
he
can
bear.”
And
yet
when
Utterson
remarked
on
his
ill-looks,
it
was
with
an
air
of
great
firmness
that
Lanyon
declared
himself
a
doomed
man.
“I
have
had
a
shock,”
he
said,
“and
I
shall
never

his
voice;
and
taking
up
his
candle,
he
led
Mr.
Utterson
back
across
the
yard
and
into
the
great
kitchen,
where
the
fire
was
out
and
the
beetles
were
leaping
on
the
floor.
“Sir,”
he
said,
looking
Mr.
Utterson
in
the
eyes,
“Was
that
my
master’s
voice?”
“It
seems
much
changed,”
replied
the
lawyer,
very
pale,
but
giving
look
for
look.
“Changed?
Well,
yes,
I
think
so,”
said
the
butler.
“Have
I
been
twenty
years
in
this
man’s
house,
to
be
deceived
about
his
voice?
No,
sir;
master’s
made
away
with;
he
was
made
away
with
eight
days
ago,
when
we
heard
him
cry
out
upon
the
name
of
God;
and
who’s
in
there
instead
of
him,
and
why
it
stays
there,
is
a
thing
that
cries
to
Heaven,
Mr.
Utterson!”
“This
is
a
very
strange
tale,
Poole;
this
is
rather
a
wild
tale
my
man,”
said
Mr.
Utterson,
biting
his
finger.
“Suppose
it
were
as
you
suppose,
supposing
Dr.
Jekyll
to
have
been--well,
murdered
what
could
induce
the
murderer
to
stay?
That
won’t
hold
water;
it
doesn’t
commend
itself
to
reason.”
“Well,
Mr.
Utterson,
you
are
a
hard
man
to
satisfy,
but
I’ll
do
it
yet,”
said
Poole.
“All
this
last
week
(you
must
know)
him,
or
it,
whatever
it
is
that
lives
in
that
cabinet,
has
been
crying
night
and
day
for
some
sort
of
medicine
and
cannot
get
it
to
his
mind.
It
was
sometimes
his
way--the
master’s,
that
is--to
write
his
orders
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
throw
it
on
the
stair.
We’ve
had
nothing
else
this
week
back;
nothing
but
papers,
and
a
closed
door,
and
the
very
meals
left
there
to
be
smuggled
in
when
nobody
was
looking.
Well,
sir,
every
day,
ay,
and
twice
and
thrice
in
the
same
day,
there
have
been
orders
and
complaints,
and
I
have
been
sent
flying
to
all
the
wholesale
chemists
in
town.
Every
time
I
brought
the
stuff
back,
there
would
be
another
paper
telling
me
to
return
it,
because
it
was
not
pure,
and
another
order
to
a
different
firm.
This
drug
is
wanted
bitter
bad,
sir,
whatever
for.”
“Have
you
any
of
these
papers?”
asked
Mr.
Utterson.
Poole
felt
in
his
pocket
and
handed
out
a
crumpled
note,
which
the
lawyer,
bending
nearer
to
the
candle,
carefully
examined.
Its
contents
ran
thus:
“Dr.
Jekyll
presents
his
compliments
to
Messrs.
Maw.
He
assures
them
that
their
last
sample
is
impure
and
quite
useless
for
his
present
purpose.
In
the
year
18--,
Dr.
J.
purchased
a
somewhat
large
quantity
from
Messrs.
M.
He
now
begs
them
to
search
with
most
sedulous
care,
and
should
any
of
the
same
quality
be
left,
forward
it
to
him
at
once.
Expense
is
no
consideration.
The
importance
of
this
to
Dr.
J.
can
hardly
be
exaggerated.”
So
far
the
letter
had
run
composedly
enough,
but
here
with
a
sudden
splutter
of
the
pen,
the
writer’s
emotion
had
broken
loose.
“For
God’s
sake,”
he
added,
“find
me
some
of
the

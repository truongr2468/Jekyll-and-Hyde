locked;
and
lying
near
by
on
the
flags,
they
found
the
key,
already
stained
with
rust.
“This
does
not
look
like
use,”
observed
the
lawyer.
“Use!”
echoed
Poole.
“Do
you
not
see,
sir,
it
is
broken?
much
as
if
a
man
had
stamped
on
it.”
“Ay,”
continued
Utterson,
“and
the
fractures,
too,
are
rusty.”
The
two
men
looked
at
each
other
with
a
scare.
“This
is
beyond
me,
Poole,”
said
the
lawyer.
“Let
us
go
back
to
the
cabinet.”
They
mounted
the
stair
in
silence,
and
still
with
an
occasional
awestruck
glance
at
the
dead
body,
proceeded
more
thoroughly
to
examine
the
contents
of
the
cabinet.
At
one
table,
there
were
traces
of
chemical
work,
various
measured
heaps
of
some
white
salt
being
laid
on
glass
saucers,
as
though
for
an
experiment
in
which
the
unhappy
man
had
been
prevented.
“That
is
the
same
drug
that
I
was
always
bringing
him,”
said
Poole;
and
even
as
he
spoke,
the
kettle
with
a
startling
noise
boiled
over.
This
brought
them
to
the
fireside,
where
the
easy-chair
was
drawn
cosily
up,
and
the
tea
things
stood
ready
to
the
sitter’s
elbow,
the
very
sugar
in
the
cup.
There
were
several
books
on
a
shelf;
one
lay
beside
the
tea
things
open,
and
Utterson
was
amazed
to
find
it
a
copy
of
a
pious
work,
for
which
Jekyll
had
several
times
expressed
a
great
esteem,
annotated,
in
his
own
hand
with
startling
blasphemies.
Next,
in
the
course
of
their
review
of
the
chamber,
the
searchers
came
to
the
cheval-glass,
into
whose
depths
they
looked
with
an
involuntary
horror.
But
it
was
so
turned
as
to
show
them
nothing
but
the
rosy
glow
playing
on
the
roof,
the
fire
sparkling
in
a
hundred
repetitions
along
the
glazed
front
of
the
presses,
and
their
own
pale
and
fearful
countenances
stooping
to
look
in.
“This
glass
has
seen
some
strange
things,
sir,”
whispered
Poole.
“And
surely
none
stranger
than
itself,”
echoed
the
lawyer
in
the
same
tones.
“For
what
did
Jekyll”--he
caught
himself
up
at
the
word
with
a
start,
and
then
conquering
the
weakness--“what
could
Jekyll
want
with
it?”
he
said.
“You
may
say
that!”
said
Poole.
Next
they
turned
to
the
business
table.
On
the
desk,
among
the
neat
array
of
papers,
a
large
envelope
was
uppermost,
and
bore,
in
the
doctor’s
hand,
the
name
of
Mr.
Utterson.
The
lawyer
unsealed
it,
and
several
enclosures
fell
to
the
floor.
The
first
was
a
will,
drawn
in
the
same
eccentric
terms
as
the
one
which
he
had
returned
six
months
before,
to
serve
as
a
testament
in
case
of
death
and
as
a
deed
of
gift
in
case
of
disappearance;
but
in
place
of
the
name
of
Edward
Hyde,
the
lawyer,
with
indescribable
amazement
read
the
name
of
Gabriel
John
Utterson.
He
looked
at
Poole,
and
then
back
at
the
paper,
and
last
of
all
at
the
dead
malefactor
stretched
upon
the
carpet.
“My
head
goes
round,”
he
said.
“He
has
been
all
these
days

and
effulgence
of
certain
of
the
powers
that
made
up
my
spirit,
but
managed
to
compound
a
drug
by
which
these
powers
should
be
dethroned
from
their
supremacy,
and
a
second
form
and
countenance
substituted,
none
the
less
natural
to
me
because
they
were
the
expression,
and
bore
the
stamp
of
lower
elements
in
my
soul.
I
hesitated
long
before
I
put
this
theory
to
the
test
of
practice.
I
knew
well
that
I
risked
death;
for
any
drug
that
so
potently
controlled
and
shook
the
very
fortress
of
identity,
might,
by
the
least
scruple
of
an
overdose
or
at
the
least
inopportunity
in
the
moment
of
exhibition,
utterly
blot
out
that
immaterial
tabernacle
which
I
looked
to
it
to
change.
But
the
temptation
of
a
discovery
so
singular
and
profound
at
last
overcame
the
suggestions
of
alarm.
I
had
long
since
prepared
my
tincture;
I
purchased
at
once,
from
a
firm
of
wholesale
chemists,
a
large
quantity
of
a
particular
salt
which
I
knew,
from
my
experiments,
to
be
the
last
ingredient
required;
and
late
one
accursed
night,
I
compounded
the
elements,
watched
them
boil
and
smoke
together
in
the
glass,
and
when
the
ebullition
had
subsided,
with
a
strong
glow
of
courage,
drank
off
the
potion.
The
most
racking
pangs
succeeded:
a
grinding
in
the
bones,
deadly
nausea,
and
a
horror
of
the
spirit
that
cannot
be
exceeded
at
the
hour
of
birth
or
death.
Then
these
agonies
began
swiftly
to
subside,
and
I
came
to
myself
as
if
out
of
a
great
sickness.
There
was
something
strange
in
my
sensations,
something
indescribably
new
and,
from
its
very
novelty,
incredibly
sweet.
I
felt
younger,
lighter,
happier
in
body;
within
I
was
conscious
of
a
heady
recklessness,
a
current
of
disordered
sensual
images
running
like
a
millrace
in
my
fancy,
a
solution
of
the
bonds
of
obligation,
an
unknown
but
not
an
innocent
freedom
of
the
soul.
I
knew
myself,
at
the
first
breath
of
this
new
life,
to
be
more
wicked,
tenfold
more
wicked,
sold
a
slave
to
my
original
evil;
and
the
thought,
in
that
moment,
braced
and
delighted
me
like
wine.
I
stretched
out
my
hands,
exulting
in
the
freshness
of
these
sensations;
and
in
the
act,
I
was
suddenly
aware
that
I
had
lost
in
stature.
There
was
no
mirror,
at
that
date,
in
my
room;
that
which
stands
beside
me
as
I
write,
was
brought
there
later
on
and
for
the
very
purpose
of
these
transformations.
The
night
however,
was
far
gone
into
the
morning--the
morning,
black
as
it
was,
was
nearly
ripe
for
the
conception
of
the
day--the
inmates
of
my
house
were
locked
in
the
most
rigorous
hours
of
slumber;
and
I
determined,
flushed
as
I
was
with
hope
and
triumph,
to
venture
in
my
new
shape
as
far
as
to
my
bedroom.
I
crossed
the
yard,
wherein
the
constellations
looked
down
upon
me,
I
could
have
thought,
with
wonder,
the
first
creature
of
that
sort
that
their
unsleeping
vigilance
had
yet

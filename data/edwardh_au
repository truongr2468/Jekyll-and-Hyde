recover.
It
is
a
question
of
weeks.
Well,
life
has
been
pleasant;
I
liked
it;
yes,
sir,
I
used
to
like
it.
I
sometimes
think
if
we
knew
all,
we
should
be
more
glad
to
get
away.”
“Jekyll
is
ill,
too,”
observed
Utterson.
“Have
you
seen
him?”
But
Lanyon’s
face
changed,
and
he
held
up
a
trembling
hand.
“I
wish
to
see
or
hear
no
more
of
Dr.
Jekyll,”
he
said
in
a
loud,
unsteady
voice.
“I
am
quite
done
with
that
person;
and
I
beg
that
you
will
spare
me
any
allusion
to
one
whom
I
regard
as
dead.”
“Tut-tut,”
said
Mr.
Utterson;
and
then
after
a
considerable
pause,
“Can’t
I
do
anything?”
he
inquired.
“We
are
three
very
old
friends,
Lanyon;
we
shall
not
live
to
make
others.”
“Nothing
can
be
done,”
returned
Lanyon;
“ask
himself.”
“He
will
not
see
me,”
said
the
lawyer.
“I
am
not
surprised
at
that,”
was
the
reply.
“Some
day,
Utterson,
after
I
am
dead,
you
may
perhaps
come
to
learn
the
right
and
wrong
of
this.
I
cannot
tell
you.
And
in
the
meantime,
if
you
can
sit
and
talk
with
me
of
other
things,
for
God’s
sake,
stay
and
do
so;
but
if
you
cannot
keep
clear
of
this
accursed
topic,
then
in
God’s
name,
go,
for
I
cannot
bear
it.”
As
soon
as
he
got
home,
Utterson
sat
down
and
wrote
to
Jekyll,
complaining
of
his
exclusion
from
the
house,
and
asking
the
cause
of
this
unhappy
break
with
Lanyon;
and
the
next
day
brought
him
a
long
answer,
often
very
pathetically
worded,
and
sometimes
darkly
mysterious
in
drift.
The
quarrel
with
Lanyon
was
incurable.
“I
do
not
blame
our
old
friend,”
Jekyll
wrote,
“but
I
share
his
view
that
we
must
never
meet.
I
mean
from
henceforth
to
lead
a
life
of
extreme
seclusion;
you
must
not
be
surprised,
nor
must
you
doubt
my
friendship,
if
my
door
is
often
shut
even
to
you.
You
must
suffer
me
to
go
my
own
dark
way.
I
have
brought
on
myself
a
punishment
and
a
danger
that
I
cannot
name.
If
I
am
the
chief
of
sinners,
I
am
the
chief
of
sufferers
also.
I
could
not
think
that
this
earth
contained
a
place
for
sufferings
and
terrors
so
unmanning;
and
you
can
do
but
one
thing,
Utterson,
to
lighten
this
destiny,
and
that
is
to
respect
my
silence.”
Utterson
was
amazed;
the
dark
influence
of
Hyde
had
been
withdrawn,
the
doctor
had
returned
to
his
old
tasks
and
amities;
a
week
ago,
the
prospect
had
smiled
with
every
promise
of
a
cheerful
and
an
honoured
age;
and
now
in
a
moment,
friendship,
and
peace
of
mind,
and
the
whole
tenor
of
his
life
were
wrecked.
So
great
and
unprepared
a
change
pointed
to
madness;
but
in
view
of
Lanyon’s
manner
and
words,
there
must
lie
for
it
some
deeper
ground.
A
week
afterwards
Dr.
Lanyon
took
to
his
bed,
and
in
something
less
than
a
fortnight
he
was
dead.

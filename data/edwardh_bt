praises
of
conscience
began
to
grow
into
a
thing
of
course;
I
began
to
be
tortured
with
throes
and
longings,
as
of
Hyde
struggling
after
freedom;
and
at
last,
in
an
hour
of
moral
weakness,
I
once
again
compounded
and
swallowed
the
transforming
draught.
I
do
not
suppose
that,
when
a
drunkard
reasons
with
himself
upon
his
vice,
he
is
once
out
of
five
hundred
times
affected
by
the
dangers
that
he
runs
through
his
brutish,
physical
insensibility;
neither
had
I,
long
as
I
had
considered
my
position,
made
enough
allowance
for
the
complete
moral
insensibility
and
insensate
readiness
to
evil,
which
were
the
leading
characters
of
Edward
Hyde.
Yet
it
was
by
these
that
I
was
punished.
My
devil
had
been
long
caged,
he
came
out
roaring.
I
was
conscious,
even
when
I
took
the
draught,
of
a
more
unbridled,
a
more
furious
propensity
to
ill.
It
must
have
been
this,
I
suppose,
that
stirred
in
my
soul
that
tempest
of
impatience
with
which
I
listened
to
the
civilities
of
my
unhappy
victim;
I
declare,
at
least,
before
God,
no
man
morally
sane
could
have
been
guilty
of
that
crime
upon
so
pitiful
a
provocation;
and
that
I
struck
in
no
more
reasonable
spirit
than
that
in
which
a
sick
child
may
break
a
plaything.
But
I
had
voluntarily
stripped
myself
of
all
those
balancing
instincts
by
which
even
the
worst
of
us
continues
to
walk
with
some
degree
of
steadiness
among
temptations;
and
in
my
case,
to
be
tempted,
however
slightly,
was
to
fall.
Instantly
the
spirit
of
hell
awoke
in
me
and
raged.
With
a
transport
of
glee,
I
mauled
the
unresisting
body,
tasting
delight
from
every
blow;
and
it
was
not
till
weariness
had
begun
to
succeed,
that
I
was
suddenly,
in
the
top
fit
of
my
delirium,
struck
through
the
heart
by
a
cold
thrill
of
terror.
A
mist
dispersed;
I
saw
my
life
to
be
forfeit;
and
fled
from
the
scene
of
these
excesses,
at
once
glorying
and
trembling,
my
lust
of
evil
gratified
and
stimulated,
my
love
of
life
screwed
to
the
topmost
peg.
I
ran
to
the
house
in
Soho,
and
(to
make
assurance
doubly
sure)
destroyed
my
papers;
thence
I
set
out
through
the
lamplit
streets,
in
the
same
divided
ecstasy
of
mind,
gloating
on
my
crime,
light-headedly
devising
others
in
the
future,
and
yet
still
hastening
and
still
hearkening
in
my
wake
for
the
steps
of
the
avenger.
Hyde
had
a
song
upon
his
lips
as
he
compounded
the
draught,
and
as
he
drank
it,
pledged
the
dead
man.
The
pangs
of
transformation
had
not
done
tearing
him,
before
Henry
Jekyll,
with
streaming
tears
of
gratitude
and
remorse,
had
fallen
upon
his
knees
and
lifted
his
clasped
hands
to
God.
The
veil
of
self-indulgence
was
rent
from
head
to
foot.
I
saw
my
life
as
a
whole:
I
followed
it
up
from
the
days
of
childhood,
when
I
had
walked
with
my
fatherâ€™s
hand,
and
through
the
self-denying
toils
of

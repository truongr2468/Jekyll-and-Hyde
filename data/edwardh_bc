to
force
our
way
into
the
cabinet.
If
all
is
well,
my
shoulders
are
broad
enough
to
bear
the
blame.
Meanwhile,
lest
anything
should
really
be
amiss,
or
any
malefactor
seek
to
escape
by
the
back,
you
and
the
boy
must
go
round
the
corner
with
a
pair
of
good
sticks
and
take
your
post
at
the
laboratory
door.
We
give
you
ten
minutes,
to
get
to
your
stations.”
As
Bradshaw
left,
the
lawyer
looked
at
his
watch.
“And
now,
Poole,
let
us
get
to
ours,”
he
said;
and
taking
the
poker
under
his
arm,
led
the
way
into
the
yard.
The
scud
had
banked
over
the
moon,
and
it
was
now
quite
dark.
The
wind,
which
only
broke
in
puffs
and
draughts
into
that
deep
well
of
building,
tossed
the
light
of
the
candle
to
and
fro
about
their
steps,
until
they
came
into
the
shelter
of
the
theatre,
where
they
sat
down
silently
to
wait.
London
hummed
solemnly
all
around;
but
nearer
at
hand,
the
stillness
was
only
broken
by
the
sounds
of
a
footfall
moving
to
and
fro
along
the
cabinet
floor.
“So
it
will
walk
all
day,
sir,”
whispered
Poole;
“ay,
and
the
better
part
of
the
night.
Only
when
a
new
sample
comes
from
the
chemist,
there’s
a
bit
of
a
break.
Ah,
it’s
an
ill
conscience
that’s
such
an
enemy
to
rest!
Ah,
sir,
there’s
blood
foully
shed
in
every
step
of
it!
But
hark
again,
a
little
closer--put
your
heart
in
your
ears,
Mr.
Utterson,
and
tell
me,
is
that
the
doctor’s
foot?”
The
steps
fell
lightly
and
oddly,
with
a
certain
swing,
for
all
they
went
so
slowly;
it
was
different
indeed
from
the
heavy
creaking
tread
of
Henry
Jekyll.
Utterson
sighed.
“Is
there
never
anything
else?”
he
asked.
Poole
nodded.
“Once,”
he
said.
“Once
I
heard
it
weeping!”
“Weeping?
how
that?”
said
the
lawyer,
conscious
of
a
sudden
chill
of
horror.
“Weeping
like
a
woman
or
a
lost
soul,”
said
the
butler.
“I
came
away
with
that
upon
my
heart,
that
I
could
have
wept
too.”
But
now
the
ten
minutes
drew
to
an
end.
Poole
disinterred
the
axe
from
under
a
stack
of
packing
straw;
the
candle
was
set
upon
the
nearest
table
to
light
them
to
the
attack;
and
they
drew
near
with
bated
breath
to
where
that
patient
foot
was
still
going
up
and
down,
up
and
down,
in
the
quiet
of
the
night.
“Jekyll,”
cried
Utterson,
with
a
loud
voice,
“I
demand
to
see
you.”
He
paused
a
moment,
but
there
came
no
reply.
“I
give
you
fair
warning,
our
suspicions
are
aroused,
and
I
must
and
shall
see
you,”
he
resumed;
“if
not
by
fair
means,
then
by
foul--if
not
of
your
consent,
then
by
brute
force!”
“Utterson,”
said
the
voice,
“for
God’s
sake,
have
mercy!”
“Ah,
that’s
not
Jekyll’s
voice--it’s
Hyde’s!”
cried
Utterson.
“Down
with
the
door,
Poole!”
Poole
swung
the
axe
over
his
shoulder;
the
blow
shook
the
building,
and
the
red
baize
door

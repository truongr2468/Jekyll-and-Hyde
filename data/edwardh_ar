it
put
a
better
colour
on
the
intimacy
than
he
had
looked
for;
and
he
blamed
himself
for
some
of
his
past
suspicions.
“Have
you
the
envelope?”
he
asked.
“I
burned
it,”
replied
Jekyll,
“before
I
thought
what
I
was
about.
But
it
bore
no
postmark.
The
note
was
handed
in.”
“Shall
I
keep
this
and
sleep
upon
it?”
asked
Utterson.
“I
wish
you
to
judge
for
me
entirely,”
was
the
reply.
“I
have
lost
confidence
in
myself.”
“Well,
I
shall
consider,”
returned
the
lawyer.
“And
now
one
word
more:
it
was
Hyde
who
dictated
the
terms
in
your
will
about
that
disappearance?”
The
doctor
seemed
seized
with
a
qualm
of
faintness;
he
shut
his
mouth
tight
and
nodded.
“I
knew
it,”
said
Utterson.
“He
meant
to
murder
you.
You
had
a
fine
escape.”
“I
have
had
what
is
far
more
to
the
purpose,”
returned
the
doctor
solemnly:
“I
have
had
a
lesson--O
God,
Utterson,
what
a
lesson
I
have
had!”
And
he
covered
his
face
for
a
moment
with
his
hands.
On
his
way
out,
the
lawyer
stopped
and
had
a
word
or
two
with
Poole.
“By
the
bye,”
said
he,
“there
was
a
letter
handed
in
to-day:
what
was
the
messenger
like?”
But
Poole
was
positive
nothing
had
come
except
by
post;
“and
only
circulars
by
that,”
he
added.
This
news
sent
off
the
visitor
with
his
fears
renewed.
Plainly
the
letter
had
come
by
the
laboratory
door;
possibly,
indeed,
it
had
been
written
in
the
cabinet;
and
if
that
were
so,
it
must
be
differently
judged,
and
handled
with
the
more
caution.
The
newsboys,
as
he
went,
were
crying
themselves
hoarse
along
the
footways:
“Special
edition.
Shocking
murder
of
an
M.P.”
That
was
the
funeral
oration
of
one
friend
and
client;
and
he
could
not
help
a
certain
apprehension
lest
the
good
name
of
another
should
be
sucked
down
in
the
eddy
of
the
scandal.
It
was,
at
least,
a
ticklish
decision
that
he
had
to
make;
and
self-reliant
as
he
was
by
habit,
he
began
to
cherish
a
longing
for
advice.
It
was
not
to
be
had
directly;
but
perhaps,
he
thought,
it
might
be
fished
for.
Presently
after,
he
sat
on
one
side
of
his
own
hearth,
with
Mr.
Guest,
his
head
clerk,
upon
the
other,
and
midway
between,
at
a
nicely
calculated
distance
from
the
fire,
a
bottle
of
a
particular
old
wine
that
had
long
dwelt
unsunned
in
the
foundations
of
his
house.
The
fog
still
slept
on
the
wing
above
the
drowned
city,
where
the
lamps
glimmered
like
carbuncles;
and
through
the
muffle
and
smother
of
these
fallen
clouds,
the
procession
of
the
town’s
life
was
still
rolling
in
through
the
great
arteries
with
a
sound
as
of
a
mighty
wind.
But
the
room
was
gay
with
firelight.
In
the
bottle
the
acids
were
long
ago
resolved;
the
imperial
dye
had
softened
with
time,
as
the
colour
grows
richer
in
stained
windows;
and
the
glow
of
hot
autumn
afternoons
on
hillside
vineyards,

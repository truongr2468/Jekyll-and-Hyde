    <h1>Topic 0</h1>

  <h2>List of Words in Topic 0</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>letter

  </ul>
  <h2>Analysis</h2>
  <p>These words indicate that some sort of letter relating to the doctor was written to a friend or possible client. In this case, the words point to a specific event in which Utterson brings a letter written by Mr. Hyde and one written by Henry Jekyll to a friend of his to compare the handwriting. He discovers through this letter that the handwriting in both Hyde's and Jekyll's letters are almost exactly identical, with Hyde having an artifically different slant in his letters. This provides the first hint that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are the same person. However, in the story itself, Utterson does not come to this conclusion until much later. During the events of this discovery, Utterson initially concludes that Jekyll had forged the letter from Hyde to try to protect the man from the law.

<h1>Topic 1</h1>
<img src="R-Files/Final/R-Plots/NLTK500/Topic1.png">
<h2>List of Words in Topic 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>city
<li>ten
<li>corner
<li>along
<li>by-street
<li>interest
<li>sound
<li>mind
<li>two
<li>face
</ul>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p> These words indicate that some event occurred on a by-street in the city. Involved with this event is noise and a face. Considering that much of the time, characters are reacting to the ugliness of Hyde's face, it can only be assumed that these events include Hyde being strongly involved. As seen in the plot above, such an event occurs twice near the beginning of the novel with some smaller concentrations towards the middle and end. The chunk at the very beginning correlates perfectly with the first portion of the book, in which Mr. Utterson and his kinsman, Mr. Enfield, talk about a mysterious door on one of the by-streets of London. Mr. Enfield here recalls a story relating to that door in which Mr. Hyde attacks a child, then goes through that door and retrieves a check for the parents of the girl in order to pay for the damages done to her. An attack would almost certainly have the elements of noise and Hyde's face, and the fact that it happens on a corner only further indicates that this topic mostly speaks about events strongly involving Hyde.

<p> The second chunk near the beginning of the novel occurs at the exact point where Utterson decides to stake out the aforementioned door in hopes of meeting Hyde. As indicated by the dark markings, Utterson does succeed. He goes on to describe Hyde's face from there.

<p> The chunk from the 10,000 word mark matches up with, once again, the event in the novel concerning Utterson's friend, Mr. Guest, analyzing the handwriting of Mr. Hyde and finding that it is nearly identical to Dr. Jekyll's. What is notable about this timeframe, however, is that soon after this event, we find that Dr. Jekyll begins coming out of seclusion and entering the city again. It is possible that Stevenson meant for these incidents to appear side-by-side to at least temporarily throw the reader off the notion that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are one and the same. However, Jekyll's sociable behavior stops just as suddenly as it began, once again piquing the reader's interest in the mystery of Jekyll's strange mannerisms.

<p> We find further on, towards the 13,000 word mark that there is yet another strong concentration of the words listed in Topic 1. This time, the important event in the novel they point towards is when Poole and the rest of Dr. Jekyll's servants call Utterson to the house because they are afraid that Mr. Hyde has done something terrible to their master. It makes great sense here why words associated with the city would show up: Utterson and Poole must first navigate the sprawling streets of London before they reach Jekyll's house. The entire section is filled with a sense of great urgency and confusion, two emotions that London's streets may invoke when it is late at night and there is a crisis happening.

<p> The final large concentration of topic words happens towards the end of the novel near the 25,000 word mark. At this point, we are now no longer seeing the story through the eyes of Mr. Utterson, but of Dr. Jekyll himself. Jekyll writes a letter describing in detail how Mr. Hyde came to be and what it was like being able to change between two personalities. He describes in great detail about the joy and thrill he felt being able to prowl London's streets as the wicked Mr. Hyde, finding catharsis in committing crimes. Then, when the morning comes, he transforms back into Dr. Jekyll so that the police are none the wiser. The city can thus be argued to be an extremely important setpiece in Stevenson's novel. It acts as both a backdrop for where the events of the novel take place and a possible corrupting influence on the once-noble character of Dr. Jekyll.

<h1>Topic 2</h1>
<img src="R-Files/Final/R-Plots/NLTK500/Topic2.png">
<h2>List of Words in Topic 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>said
<li>Utterson
<li>man
<li>one
<li>Jekyll
<li>Hyde
<li>lawyer
<li>upon
<li>like
<li>would
</ul>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>This set of words is mostly concentrated on the characters. We see the three main characters of Utterson, Jekyll, and Hyde featured here, as well as Utterson's occupation. The word "said" being included here indicates that the novel is extremely character and dialogue-driven. Both of these facts are quite true. In addition, there is a distinct lack of women names in the compiled list. This indicates that the novel is also male-based, which is also true.

<h1>Topic 3</h1>
<img src="R-Files/Final/R-Plots/NLTK500/Topic3.png">
<h2>List of Words in Topic 3</h2>
<ul>
<li>maid
<li>victim
<li>heavy
<li>stick
<li>lane
<li>gentleman
<li>body
<li>seen
<li>broken
<li>particularly
</ul>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>The event Topic 3 points to is easy to identify: it takes place at the point in the story in which both Utterson and the reader finds out about Mr. Hyde's first murder. In this particular scene, we hear from a maid who witnessed the murder about how Hyde used a heavy walking stick to beat a gentleman to death. The maid goes on to describe how the body seemed very broken.

<h1>Topic 4</h1>
<img src="R-Files/Final/R-Plots/NLTK500/Topic4.png">
<h2>List of Words in Topic 4</h2>
<ul>
<li>guest
<li>clerk
<li>document
<li>death
<li>sir
<li>note
<li>tempted
<li>autograph
<li>public
<li>handwriting
</ul>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>This list of words, once again, points towards Mr. Guest's analysis of Mr. Hyde's handwriting. This is the event indicated near the 10,000 word mark. However, there also seems to be a set of lines just before and just past the 15,000 word mark.

<p>The set just before the 15,000 word mark, interestingly enough, has little to do with Dr. Jekyll's or Mr. Hyde's handwriting. Rather, it makes much greater use of the words "sir" and "death." In this particular moment, the servant, Poole, is speaking to Utterson about his great concern for Dr. Jekyll. He talks about how he fears that someone - likely Mr. Hyde - has murdered Dr. Jekyll and taken his place as master of the house, but hides away so that the servants never see his face. Throughout this conversation, Poole addresses Utterson as "sir" to indicate the lawyer's superiority. This provides an interesting examination on the dynamics of class within society at the time. Even though Utterson is technically not Poole's master, he is still addressed as a superior by the butler.

<p>The set just after the 15,000 word mark, once again, makes great use of the word "sir." However, it also makes use of the idea of a handwritten document or note and the death of a friend. In this case, the Utterson and the reader are in the middle of reading a letter from the late Dr. Lanyon about how he witnessed Dr. Jekyll changing into Mr. Hyde. This event traumatized Lanyon so much that he would eventually die, with this letter being the last thing he ever writes. At this point, it can be said that Stevenson combines the handwritten letters and the class distinctions of society to produce a letter from Lanyon that reveals almost all of Dr. Jekyll's darkest secrets.

<h1>Topic 5</h1>
<img src="R-Files/Final/R-Plots/NLTK500/Topic5.png">
<h2>List of Words in Topic 5</h2>
<ul>
<li>two
<li>even
<li>life
<li>die
<li>evil
<li>pleasures
<li>months
<li>made
<li>side
<li>moral
</ul>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>This word list almost certainly captures two of the greatest themes found in the novel: the ideas of duality and morality. As one can clearly see in the plot, these two themes occur mostly at the beginning and the end of the novel.

<p>The presence of the themes at the beginning of the novel introduces the idea of morality and duality early-on. We encounter Mr. Hyde for the first time through Enfield's story of the door and hear from his description that he is evil. We also get introduced to the idea of two, as Enfield and Utterson are described in the opening lines of the novel as a pair. Although Enfield will not appear again once he finishes his story about the door, the reader is nevertheless introduced quickly to the idea of two very early on. It seems almost fitting, then, that as the novel moves towards a close, the idea of two and the morality associated with two is mentioned more and more often, particularly in terms of Dr. Jekyll's explanation of his experiment and the subsequent birth of Mr. Hyde. The large stretch of dark patches at the very end of the novel seems to bring <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> full-circle. The novel begins with two people discussing the strangeness of Mr. Hyde, and the novel ends with the death of two men: both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

<h1>Topic 6</h1>
<img src="R-Files/Final/R-Plots/NLTK500/Topic6.png">
<h2>List of Words in Topic 6</h2>
<ul>
<li>visitor
<li>curiosity
<li>ordinary
<li>remember
<li>sense
<li>unknown
<li>person
<li>struck
<li>set
<li>conduct
</ul>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>The greatest concentrations of this set of words occurs during the second half of the novel, at around the 17,000 word mark and just before the 25,000 word mark. This set of words seems to indicate that a curious visitor arrived at some point who was either memorable or invoked memory. This person was likely a stranger. If this assumption were applied to the 17,000 word mark, one would almost immediately see that this is indeed the case. At the 17,000 word mark, the reader and Utterson are reading Dr. Lanyon's letter. In this letter, Lanyon details his encounter with Mr. Hyde, in which he witnesses the transformation into Dr. Jekyll.

<p>For the word set just before the 25,000 word mark, this matches up perfectly with Dr. Jekyll's letter, in which he reveals all the secrets of his work to Utterson. At this particular moment, Dr. Jekyll talks about the night after the murder and the simultaneous horror and elation he felt at completing such a crime. He shows here the theme of duality that runs throughout the novel, acknowledging his sense of horror while also portraying an underlying sense of elation. He indicates that he will always remember the night of the murder, for good or for ill.

<h1>Topic 7</h1>
<img src="R-Files/Final/R-Plots/NLTK500/Topic7.png">
<h2>List of Words in Topic 7</h2>
<ul>
<li>many
<li>liked
<li>others
<li>ill
<li>clear
<li>secrets
<li>past
<li>things
<li>chief
<li>friendship
</ul>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>This topic is primarily concentrated at the 5,000 and 10,000 word marks. Based on the words alone, a reader would be able to conclude that at those two points in the novel, the characters are concerned about a past friendship that might be marred by the members of that friendship keeping secrets. This is quite possibly the case with the 5,000 word mark, as careful analysis of it points the reader to a small event in which Mr. Utterson attempts to find out more about Mr. Hyde, eventually coming to the conclusion that Hyde is somehow manipulating Jekyll into using his wealth and influence to benefit him. The thought of the two men being one and the same has not yet crossed Utterson's mind as this point. Utterson therefore finds himself reflecting on his past friendship with Dr. Jekyll and wondering what sort of secrets the doctor is hiding that might have him under the control of Mr. Hyde. Of particular note is that soon after this scene, Henry Jekyll appears in the novel for the first time, alive and seemingly well despite Utterson's misgivings.

<p>The 10,000 word point is also highly concerned with a past friendship marred by secrets. At this point in the novel, Utterson visits his and Jekyll's old mutual friend, Dr. Lanyon, who has taken ill after witnessing a great shock. This shock, the reader will learn later, is the shock of seeing Mr. Hyde transform into Dr. Jekyll. This event also occurs right after Mr. Hyde's murder, indicating that Lanyon's illness and the murder might be connected. Indeed, it is; now that Lanyon knows Dr. Jekyll's secret, he shows here that the friendship they once had is now in the past. Lanyon has taken ill and now never wants to see or hear of Henry Jekyll ever again. He is sickened by the depravity that Mr. Hyde shows and is tired of the secrets that Jekyll held so close. Therefore, the reader sees in this scene the end of a strong friendship and the beginning of the secret being unravelled.

<h1>Topic 8</h1>
<img src="R-Files/Final/R-Plots/NLTK500/Topic8.png">
<h2>List of Words in Topic 8</h2>
<ul>
<li>creature
<li>evil
<li>horror
<li>countenance
<li>drugs
<li>hours
<li>beyond
<li>life
<li>sensations
<li>pangs
</ul>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>The words of Topic 8 occur most often towards the end of the novel, during the time Utterson reads Jekyll's final letter to him detailing the full extent of Dr. Jekyll's connection with Mr. Hyde. All of the words found in Topic 8 are those that describe exactly what kind of creature Mr. Hyde is: an evil person with a horrific countenance born from a drug and Dr. Jekyll's hubris. The fact that Jekyll alternates between using the more positive-sounding "sensations" and the more negative-sounding "pangs" once again puts forth the idea of a duality in human nature. Jekyll at first is excited by his discovery. He embraces Hyde as another side of himself and loses himself in the pleasure of revelry and general misdeeds without harming the reputation of himself as a doctor. However, as his time as Mr. Hyde grows darker and darker, Jekyll begins using words such as "evil" and "horror" to describe what Hyde has become. The fact that "hours" shows up in this set of words as well gives off the sense that both Jekyll and Hyde are finite. Hours shows the passage of time, indicating that no matter how noble and good Jekyll seems to be, and no matter how evil wicked wicked Hyde is, they are both subject to time's passage. Good and evil is therefore made a struggle that is not necessarily eternal; both are subject to time in the end.

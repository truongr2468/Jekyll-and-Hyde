  <h2>List of Words in Topic 0</h2>

  </ul>
  <h2>Analysis</h2>
  <p>These words indicate that some sort of letter relating to the doctor was written to a friend or possible client. In this case, the words point to a specific event in which Utterson brings a letter written by Mr. Hyde and one written by Henry Jekyll to a friend of his to compare the handwriting. He discovers through this letter that the handwriting in both Hyde's and Jekyll's letters are almost exactly identical, with Hyde having an artifically different slant in his letters. This provides the first hint that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are the same person. However, in the story itself, Utterson does not come to this conclusion until much later. During the events of this discovery, Utterson initially concludes that Jekyll had forged the letter from Hyde to try to protect the man from the law.

<h1>Topic 1</h1>
<img src="R-Files/Final/R-Plots/NLTK500/Topic1.png">
<h2>List of Words in Topic 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>city
<li>ten
<li>corner
<li>along
<li>by-street
<li>interest
<li>sound
<li>mind
<li>two
<li>face
</ul>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p> These words indicate that some event occurred on a by-street in the city. Involved with this event is noise and a face. Considering that much of the time, characters are reacting to the ugliness of Hyde's face, it can only be assumed that these events include Hyde being strongly involved. As seen in the plot above, such an event occurs twice near the beginning of the novel with some smaller concentrations towards the middle and end. The chunk at the very beginning correlates perfectly with the first portion of the book, in which Mr. Utterson and his kinsman, Mr. Enfield, talk about a mysterious door on one of the by-streets of London. Mr. Enfield here recalls a story relating to that door in which Mr. Hyde attacks a child, then goes through that door and retrieves a check for the parents of the girl in order to pay for the damages done to her. An attack would almost certainly have the elements of noise and Hyde's face, and the fact that it happens on a corner only further indicates that this topic mostly speaks about events strongly involving Hyde.

<p> The second chunk near the beginning of the novel occurs at the exact point where Utterson decides to stake out the aforementioned door in hopes of meeting Hyde. As indicated by the dark markings, Utterson does succeed. He goes on to describe Hyde's face from there.

<p> The chunk from the 10,000 word mark matches up with, once again, the event in the novel concerning Utterson's friend, Mr. Guest, analyzing the handwriting of Mr. Hyde and finding that it is nearly identical to Dr. Jekyll's. What is notable about this timeframe, however, is that soon after this event, we find that Dr. Jekyll begins coming out of seclusion and entering the city again. It is possible that Stevenson meant for these incidents to appear side-by-side to at least temporarily throw the reader off the notion that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are one and the same. However, Jekyll's sociable behavior stops just as suddenly as it began, once again piquing the reader's interest in the mystery of Jekyll's strange mannerisms.

<p> We find further on, towards the 13,000 word mark that there is yet another strong concentration of the words listed in Topic 1. This time, the important event in the novel they point towards is when Poole and the rest of Dr. Jekyll's servants call Utterson to the house because they are afraid that Mr. Hyde has done something terrible to their master. It makes great sense here why words associated with the city would show up: Utterson and Poole must first navigate the sprawling streets of London before they reach Jekyll's house. The entire section is filled with a sense of great urgency and confusion, two emotions that London's streets may invoke when it is late at night and there is a crisis happening.

<p> The final large concentration of topic words happens towards the end of the novel near the 25,000 word mark. At this point, we are now no longer seeing the story through the eyes of Mr. Utterson, but of Dr. Jekyll himself. Jekyll writes a letter describing in detail how Mr. Hyde came to be and what it was like being able to change between two personalities. He describes in great detail about the joy and thrill he felt being able to prowl London's streets as the wicked Mr. Hyde, finding catharsis in committing crimes. Then, when the morning comes, he transforms back into Dr. Jekyll so that the police are none the wiser. The city can thus be argued to be an extremely important setpiece in Stevenson's novel. It acts as both a backdrop for where the events of the novel take place and a possible corrupting influence on the once-noble character of Dr. Jekyll.

<h1>Topic 2</h1>
<img src="R-Files/Final/R-Plots/NLTK500/Topic2.png">
<h2>List of Words in Topic 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>said
<li>Utterson
<li>man
<li>one
<li>Jekyll
<li>Hyde
<li>lawyer
<li>upon
<li>like
<li>would
</ul>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>This set of words is mostly concentrated on the characters. We see the three main characters of Utterson, Jekyll, and Hyde featured here, as well as Utterson's occupation. The word "said" being included here indicates that the novel is extremely character and dialogue-driven. Both of these facts are quite true. In addition, there is a distinct lack of women names in the compiled list. This indicates that the novel is also male-based, which is also true.

<h1>Topic 3</h1>
<img src="R-Files/Final/R-Plots/NLTK500/Topic3.png">
<h2>List of Words in Topic 3</h2>
<ul>
<li>maid
<li>victim
<li>heavy
<li>stick
<li>lane
<li>gentleman
<li>body
<li>seen
<li>broken
<li>particularly
</ul>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>The event Topic 3 points to is easy to identify: it takes place at the point in the story in which both Utterson and the reader finds out about Mr. Hyde's first murder. In this particular scene, we hear from a maid who witnessed the murder about how Hyde used a heavy walking stick to beat a gentleman to death. The maid goes on to describe how the body seemed very broken.

<h1>Topic 4</h1>

<li>clerk
<li>document
<li>death
<li>sir
<li>note
<li>tempted
<li>autograph
<li>public
<li>handwriting
</ul>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>This list of words, once again, points towards Mr. Guest's analysis of Mr. Hyde's handwriting. This is the event indicated near the 10,000 word mark. However, there also seems to be a set of lines just before and just past the 15,000 word mark.
